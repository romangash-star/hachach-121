     1 CLAIM     אמת/שקר   answered, NOT resolved
     2 POSITION  the player as the 121st MK, unscored
     3 CONTEXT   one line, no fields read (T5; was bill_title + bill_date)
     4 CASCADE   one MK at a time, predict then instant verdict
     5 REVEAL    claim resolves · tally counts up · resolution · sources

   This file reads data.js and never writes to it. Copy is read out of
   data.js by id; anything Tamar has not written renders as a marked

   COIN TABLES — and the disagreement between them.

   'sheet'  §0.3 as audited, plus §1.4d. The claim pays only if correct;
            beat 2 pays NOTHING, because §1.4d is categorical: "beat 2 is
            never scored, never rewarded, never compared to a correct
            answer." Topic completion pays 100 — which the shipped code
            does not do at all.
   'brief'  the table confirmed in the brief: 25 for answering the claim,
            25 for taking a position, 25 per correct cascade guess. This
            is what app.js actually does today.

   CONSEQUENCE OF 'sheet', and it is a real one: a correct-only claim
   award cannot fire at beat 1, because paying out would resolve the
   claim four beats early. Under 'sheet' it is deferred to beat 5.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* ===== §0 · THE AWARD TABLE ==========================================
   WHY IT CHANGED. The old table paid nothing for finishing and nothing
   for taking a position, so a round's whole value was its cascade: r1
   (9 MK cards) paid 250 and the five rounds with no MK data at all paid
   25. A 10:1 spread between rounds that look identical from the player's
   side — and the short ones are short because of a DATA GAP, not because
   they are worth less. The table was teaching that long rounds matter
   more, which is false.

   THE TACHLES AWARD IS FLAT AND UNCONDITIONAL. Identical for בעד, נגד
   and נמנע, paid the moment a position is taken, never scored and never
   compared against anything. It is what makes the 121st-MK conceit true
   mechanically — the player's position counts — and the instant it is
   conditional on being "right" it becomes an opinion poll with a grade
   on it. Nothing near it may carry a correctness colour, a tick, or
   verdict language. See pinVote() and the note at the beat-2 award.

   NOTHING IS ADVERTISED BEFORE A CHOICE. There is no "+25" beside the
   vote chips or on the claim card anywhere in this file. A price tag
   before a decision moves attention from the content to the points, and
   on the tachles beat it would turn taking a position into a
   transaction. Feedback lands AFTER: the coin flies, the counter ticks.

   `brief` IS THE RECORD OF WHAT THE BRIEF SAID, not a live mode. It is
   kept so the disagreement stays visible; only `sheet` is reachable
   without a query string. */

   the player has said about themselves, and it is ADDITIVE to the save —
   a save written before it simply has none and restores to these
   defaults, the same reasoning `cf` used. No SAVE_VER bump.
     avatarId · a preset's id. Defaults to the first preset at boot.
     name     · optional, cleaned by cleanName(), at most NAME_MAX. The
                field is in 2b; the keyboard it summons is handled by
                kbSync() (§N) and is the one thing here that can only be
                verified on a phone.
     gender   · null | 'm' | 'f'. null is the PLURAL copy, which is what
                the game speaks today. NEVER forced: the board draws
                לשון זכר selected and app.js writes 'm' on save, and both
                are the old build.
     invited  · Part C's once-only flag — the identity-moment invitation
                has been shown (or forfeited) and never comes back.
     cfg      · the built character (§D): {skin, hair, hairColor, eyes,
                clothes, bg}, option ids from BLD. null = the preset wins;
                set, it outranks the preset — see avatarSvg(). */

/* ===================== §D · THE BUILT CHARACTER ====================
   The eight presets are hand-drawn single SVGs; nothing can edit them.
   So the builder is not "adjust this one" — it is "build your own from
   nothing", and what it builds is drawn by THIS generator, ported from
   app.js:4-94 (the source of truth the Builder boards cite for "every
   category and label"). Two representations coexist in PROFILE — a
   chosen preset (avatarId) or a built character (cfg) — exactly one is
   active, and neither destroys the other; see avatarSvg() for which.

   THE SIX AXES: the CHAR board's five in its order, ids/colours/labels
   as shipped, then the BACKGROUND, which is ours. app.js painted the
   square behind the figure as the outfit at 15%, the presets paint it as
   the skin, and the disc shell reads that square's fill as the disc —
   so under the shell a build's face and ground were one colour and the
   head had no edge; at s4/s5 the figure vanished into itself. The ground
   is CHOSEN now: six flat neutrals and tints that sit apart from every
   skin tone (all five skins are hue 25–27; the nearest ground is kraft
   at hue 43 with a third of the saturation, and the four tints are 100+
   hues away), none of them lime or magenta, the default being the tone
   AV3's own disc wears. The grey is the one DARK ground, pushed cool
   (hue 213) and well below kraft in value: a pale grey sat at the same
   value as kraft and was a wasted option. Labels are ours, a TAMAR item.
   One set of shipped labels is not words: the skin tones are labelled
   with the emoji skin-tone modifiers 🏻…🏿, which are swatches, not
   names — Part B shows the colour and leaves the naming to Tamar. */

     · axis values are ids resolved through BLD (hex accepted).
     · a missing skin falls back to BLD_SKIN_DEFAULT, not s1.
     · the background rect is the chosen bg axis, opaque, not the outfit
       at 15%: roundShell() reads that rect's fill as the disc. (The
       outfit tint would have become a solid outfit-coloured disc; the
       skin tone, tried first, left the head with no edge.)
     · no xmlns on the root — inline SVG, same as the presets.
   NOT here, tried and removed: a paper keyline inside every hair shape,

   hair and as beads on curly — a different hairstyle, not a rim. With

     T25 · THE END SEQUENCE JOINS THE TABLE.
     Ten second-person strings across the four ending screens were bare
     literals in the plural, so a player who had set a gender was addressed
     as a group for the last four screens of the game. They are routed
     here now, like every other string that speaks to the player.

     EIGHT OF THE TEN HAVE ONE SINGULAR FORM, AND THAT IS A FACT ABOUT
     THESE WORDS RATHER THAN ABOUT SINGULAR. Hebrew's second-person
     singular PAST is spelled identically for את and אתה unvocalised —
     סיימת, הצבעת, חילקת — and so are the singular dative and possessive:
     לך, שלך, אותך, תורך. The brief's warning about צדקת/טעית is exactly
     right and it is why every slot below is written out in full rather
     than one form being assigned to both: the day one of these strings
     is re-worded into an imperative or a present tense, m and f diverge,
     and a table that had collapsed them would go on printing one form
     for both without anything failing.
     THE TWO THAT ALREADY DIVERGE ARE THE IMPERATIVES — alloc's חילקו and
     the picker's בחרו. They are the proof of the paragraph above.

   issues carry MK vote data at all, and accountability is the ONLY topic

   where the player is guaranteed to have just played a normal cascade in
   the SAME TOPIC, arriving here by לסוגיה הבאה — pattern first, break

   IT NEVER REACHES ZERO while the question is open. 1px is a softened
   photograph of a real politician, which is fine; the sequence has no
   step that deforms a face, because every step is a Gaussian blur and a
   Gaussian blur cannot deform — it only removes. That is the whole

/* THE DEALING RULE, and it had to be written rather than assumed. It is
   TWO constraints, and the second one only became visible once the first
   was built and the deal was read back off the running page.

   1 · THE STATED VOTE MUST NOT IDENTIFY THE ANSWER.
   a2 is 3 for / 3 against, so an unconstrained trio hands the player
   one, two or three names all holding the stated vote at random. The
   question is "who is this" and its answer is the FACE — there is never
   more than one correct name — but how far the stated vote narrows the
   field is a design decision, not an accident:
     one of three holds it  -> the clue is SUFFICIENT. a2's split IS the
       coalition/opposition line, so anyone who can read that answers
       without ever looking at the face and the blur is decoration again
       — which is the flaw that got the earlier options rejected.
     two of three hold it   -> the clue narrows three to two and the FACE
       decides. Knowledge helps; recognition finishes.
   Shipping two.

   2 · THE FREE PARTY HINT MUST NOT IDENTIFY THE ANSWER EITHER, and this
   is the one that nearly shipped broken. In a2 all three `for` MKs are
   הליכוד and each of the three `against` MKs is a party of one. So if
   the pictured MK is drawn from the opposition side, "the party is יש
   עתיד" IS the answer, spelled out, for free, in one tap. A hint that
   resolves the question is a solve button, and a free solve button is
   the round not existing.
   So the pictured MK is drawn only from those who have same-party
   company in the pool, and EXACTLY ONE distractor shares their party.
   The hint then always narrows three to two and never to one.

   WHAT FALLS OUT OF THIS IN a2, and it is a fact about the data rather
   than about the rule: party and vote are perfectly correlated on the
   coalition side, so the pair the vote clue leaves and the pair the
   party hint leaves are THE SAME PAIR. The hint is redundant with the
   stated vote for a player who reasons from the vote, and still useful
   to one who does not. It is never misleading and never sufficient,
   which is the bar. On an issue whose parties cross the vote line the
   two clues would narrow to different pairs and intersect on the
   answer — the rule is written for that case too. */

   lines later, the throw left `issue` pointing at a2 while S still held
   the PREVIOUS round. a2 could not be opened at all and the inverted
   round was unreachable in the build.

   IT HAS TO BE SEEDED, not Math.random(): the note above says so, ?invseed
   exists to vary it deliberately, and the contrast with the normal deal
   is the point — newRound() shuffles the cascade with Math.random() and
   this one is repeatable so a screenshot and a playtest are.

/* ===================== HAPTICS · §5, after O2 ======================
   iOS SAFARI DOES NOT IMPLEMENT THE VIBRATION API AT ALL. Confirmed
   against MDN's browser-compat-data: safari is version_added:false and
   safari_ios mirrors it. On an iPhone every call here is absent — not a
   silent failure to fix. Android only, and that has not changed.

   THREE EVENTS, AND NOW THE FILE MEANS IT. This comment used to say
   "three events, and only three" while ten call sites existed: every
   button press, the drag crossing, both stamps, the banner handoff, the
   finale flare, the 121st, the coin flight and a carousel step. An
   instrumented round measured FOURTEEN pulses on a five-card cascade —
   about 370 a session over 22 rounds. A tick on every tap is not
   feedback, it is a texture the player eventually escapes by turning
   vibration off at the OS, which costs them every other app on the
   phone. O2 is the subtraction. What is left is below, and the table IS
   the list.

   ── THE TABLE IS THE GUARD ─────────────────────────────────────────
   buzz() takes the NAME of an event, never a duration. A call that does
   not name one of these three does nothing, so the rule is enforced by
   identity rather than by a clock.
   THAT IS WHAT CLOSED THE BEAT-2 ESCAPE. The old guard was
   `if (S.beat === 2) return`, and the banner handoff defeated it by
   arithmetic: it is scheduled at tcTravelAt + tcTravel = 1120ms while
   beat3() starts at tcNextAt = 900ms, so the pulse landed 220ms after
   the counter ticked over, wore beat 3's number and fired. Measured, in
   the instrumented timeline, as `7037ms 18ms beat 3`. It was rewarding
   the player's own vote — the one input §1.4d says is never scored,
   never rewarded and never compared to a correct answer.
   The beat check is GONE rather than hardened. A guard that asks what
   time it is can always be beaten by something scheduled later; a guard
   that asks what the pulse IS cannot. There is no event named for beat 2
   in this table, so no call from beat 2 can fire — including one that
   arrives after the beat has advanced.

   CAN_BUZZ IS A PRESENCE CHECK AND NOTHING MAY BRANCH ON IT AS THOUGH IT
   MEANT MORE. `typeof navigator.vibrate === 'function'` is true on a
   MacBook with no vibration motor — measured. navigator.vibrate() also
   RETURNS true there, so the return value is no better: true means the
   call was accepted, never that the phone buzzed. Firefox Android is the
   proof by counter-example — vibration is disabled outright and it still
   returns true. There is no way to feature-detect a haptic, so nothing
   in this app may show, hide, promise or explain anything on the
   strength of it.

   IT RIDES THE SOUND SWITCH. See sndOn(): one control for both channels,
   because both are the same request — do not make my phone do things.

   scheduled off a decode, and a missing buffer is silence rather than a
   wait. See sfx().

   OFF BY DEFAULT, and that is not timidity: sound-on by default on a
   phone is how a teenager kills the tab in a classroom.

   EVERY SOUND IS CAUSED BY SOMETHING THE PLAYER DID, at the moment they
   did it. That is the rule the set is built against and it is what keeps

   ~450ms per token, ~40ms apart, ease-out, on an arc — and the SHAPE of

   the leading side and the coin chip sits at the top of the opposite side,

   across the middle of the card, which is exactly where the portrait is.

   and the portrait occupies (90..350, 240..415): straight through a face.

   SO IT GOES OUT, UP AND IN. Both control points sit in the GUTTER beside
   the card — the ~14px of ground between the card's edge and the stage —
   which turns the path into an S: the token leaves the stamp sideways,
   climbs the gutter clear of the artwork, and cuts in to the chip across
   the empty strip ABOVE the card. It touches the card only in its blank
   outer margin, never the portrait, the name plate or the stamp it just
   left. It is also fired AFTER the verdict has landed at every call site,

   the coin chip opposite it, so it read as a status pip rather than as
   the player's held commitment — and being absolutely positioned over the
   play area it sat ON the card and clipped the first letter of the MK's
   name (איתמר בן-גביר rendering as יתמר בן-גביר). The chyron is in FLOW
   between the HUD and the round, so it cannot overlap the card at any
   viewport: the card's top edge starts below it, by construction.

   The element itself lives in index.html and is never created or removed,
   only filled and emptied — see .chyron.is-empty for why it keeps its box
   on beat 1.                                                           */

   ONE COMPONENT, TWO COPY STRINGS, and never two components. B2-4 was

   element — without this, a returning player opens their second issue and
   the claim card carries no instruction at all.

   IT COSTS THE CARD NOTHING. The sticker is parented to .cardwrap, not to
   the card: .mf-b carries overflow:hidden and would clip it, and anything
   inside the card face would push the name/party block toward the stamp's
   430px band. It overhangs the card's top-right corner, which is the
   corner diagonally opposite the stamp (top:430 left:-22) — the two can
   never meet on any card.

   IT IS CHROME-SCALE, NOT CARD-SCALE. .stack is scaled by sizeStage() so
   a 620px card fits a short phone; left alone the sticker would shrink
   with it and the instruction would be smallest exactly where the screen
   is smallest. .ask-st counter-scales by 1/--card-scale so the settled

   LION'S DECISION, 09 SEP, TAKEN OVER A STOP I RAISED — recorded that way
   on purpose. The locked list named the MK disc as the ONLY surface
   allowed "טעית", so this was flagged rather than applied; Lion widened
   the exception to TWO SURFACES. It is his call, not a reading of the
   old rule, and not something a later editor may extend a third time.

   WAS: 'צדקתם!' / 'הופתעתם!' — plural, and "surprised" where the disc
   said "wrong". Two voices four seconds apart in one round.

   THE PLURAL WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT, WHICH IS WHY THIS NEEDS SAYING OUT
   LOUD: t() treats the PLURAL as the gender-neutral voice, not as a
   fallback — PROFILE.gender === null resolves to the `p` slot, and that
   is the state of every player who skips or un-picks the voice step.
   Some two dozen second-person strings speak אתם there.

   >>> THIS PILL IS A DELIBERATE EXCEPTION TO IT, NOT DRIFT AWAY FROM IT,
   >>> AND NOT A PRECEDENT. If you are reading this while making some
   >>> other string singular: don't. Nothing here licenses that.

   WHAT THE SINGULAR COSTS TAMAR: nothing. צדקת and טעית are spelled
   identically in the masculine and feminine second-person past —
   צָדַקְתָּ/צָדַקְתְּ and טָעִיתָ/טָעִית differ only in pointing, which
   this build does not set — so neither adds a slot to the gendered set.
   It also RETIRES a debt: 'צדקתם'/'הופתעתם' are masculine plural, the

     the CLAIM rather than on the person who answered. It now carries the
     avatar — the same AV3 that is the player everywhere else in the app,
     in the HUD and pinned in this very slot two beats later — so the
     colour attaches to a face and the sentence reads "you were right",

     banner-style across the disc's LOWER EDGE, 4px higher than the board.
     Two consequences worth writing down, because both are easy to undo by
     accident:
       · IT IS PARENTED TO .cardwrap, NOT TO THE CARD, for the same two
         reasons the stamp is — .mf-b clips, and the card is a 3D flipper
         that would mirror anything inside it. The pill overhangs the
         card's start edge and must be allowed to.
       · IT THEREFORE HAS TO LEAVE WITH THE CARD. Under the chyron it was
         removed on הלאה; on .cardwrap it would be left hanging in mid-air
         while the card and the stamp fly out. See the exit below.
     THE CHYRON SLOT IS UNAFFECTED. The reserved 44px box is .chyron-slot,
     a separate element that stays in .sc-round's FLOW on every beat;
     .chyron is the absolutely-positioned banner that was placed over it.
     So the pill vacating the banner collapses nothing and shifts nothing
     below it — .chyron simply stays .is-empty through the reveal, exactly

     T18 · THE ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE.
     It used to be: the card rearranged, then the stamp fell onto the
     rearranged card, then the panel. The card moved before the player
     had been shown anything, so the movement ANTICIPATED the verdict
     instead of reacting to it — the one thing a reveal must not do.

     Now the stamp lands on the card AS IT STANDS. Everything above this
     point is untouched: --t-stamp-land's fall, ITEM 47B's --t-mark-gap
     held beat, and the pill arriving on the stamp after it. That whole
     run is one statement — the verdict — and item 50's pill is part of
     it, not a separate event to sequence around.

     THEN NOTHING MOVES FOR --t-claim-hold, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The
     jolt is the cue: d2-jolt-claim runs 120ms from --t-stamp-drop-mk and
     is finished at 320ms, well inside the 360ms landing, so by the time
     the pill has settled the card has been still for a while. The hold
     is what separates the verdict from the card's reaction to it. Under
     it the two motions read as one gesture and the cause-and-effect this
     reorder exists for is lost.

     THE PANEL COMES AFTER THE RISE, NOT WITH IT. With it and the card is
     doing two things at once again, which is what was wrong before.
     Before it is not available: the panel takes the room the rise
     creates. After, separated by --t-panel-gap, which is the token that

     sliced horizontally through the middle of a line of Hebrew. That is
     indistinguishable from a rendering fault, and the reflex it produces

   v30c · THE RESET CONFIRM. The only irreversible action in the game.

   IT IS .exitsheet's CONSTRUCTION, NOT A SECOND MODAL SHAPE. Paper on a
   dark scrim, white die-cut, keyline, hard offset, laid down at a tilt.
   The build has one modal shape and this does not add another; it adds a
   perforation to the one that exists.

   THE ESCALATION IS MATERIAL, NOT CHROMATIC, and that is forced rather
   than chosen: lime and magenta code correctness only and cannot be
   spent on danger. A perforation is native to a die-cut sticker system
   and means exactly one thing — this comes apart. Nothing else in the
   build has one, so it cannot be read as anything else.

   THE COST IS IN FIGURES. The chips say how much is lost rather than
   calling it "progress"; the exit confirm already sets that precedent
   for a round, and this is the same idea at the scale of a run. A player
   agreeing to a quantity is making a different decision from one
   agreeing to a word.

   THE SAFE OPTION IS THE PRIMARY. Yellow, 56px, full extrusion, first in
   reading order, above the tear. The destructive one is 46px, outlined,
   flush, below it — and the ✕ is a third way out, in the corner the

/* ===== B3-3 · THE DIE-CUT STICKER MODAL ==============================
   ONE COMPONENT, TWO CONTENTS, and that is the whole point of building it
   this way. B3-3 was picked for the law modal and §3.1 moves the glossary
   term onto the same treatment; a second modal would be a second set of
   paddings, a second dismiss and a second way for the two to drift apart.
   Everything that differs between the two is an ARGUMENT — title, meta,
   body, optional graphic — and everything that is shared is the sticker.

   IT IS CENTRED, WHICH COSTS SOMETHING AND IS STILL RIGHT. The v17 board
   recorded the objection: centring covers the tachles question while the
   law is open, so the player loses the thing they were about to answer.
   That is true of the glossary term too. The trade is deliberate — the
   modal is a detour the player asked for, it dismisses three ways, and
   the question is intact underneath it the instant it closes.

   THREE WAYS OUT, none of them hidden: the ✕, the ground, and Escape.

   SPOILER RISK carries over unchanged: on s1 and m2 the bill text names
   an MK who is in that round's own cascade. Tamar's copy is not edited
   and no MK is dropped; both issues carry `spoiler_risk:true` in data.js
   and stay on her list. The treatment cannot fix that; only her copy can.  */

   replacing means building the same markup again from a different options
   object. Nothing about the markup changed in the move — only `nested`

/* T5b · THE OUTCOME SENTENCE COMES OFF THE BILL SUMMARY BEFORE IT IS SHOWN.
   bill_summary is a CONTEXT field with an OUTCOME sentence welded onto the
   end of it on some issues — s1 finishes "עבר 61 מול 55." and its own
   _tally is {for:61, against:55}, the exact pair the finale board counts up
   to. The modal opens at beat 2. Left whole, the field hands the player the
   answer two beats before the cascade asks for it, which is the locked
   "crowd data never appears between the player's own vote and the reveal".
   The split is here rather than in data.js because the field is Tamar's to
   write and Roman's to serve; this is the one place it is read.

   THE BOUNDARY IS A SENTENCE, NOT A SUBSTRING. Cutting at the first digit
   would have taken e1's "המע\"מ ל-18%", a1's "90 ח\"כים" and v1's climate
   targets — all context, all load-bearing. The unit removed is the final
   SENTENCE, and only when that sentence carries a vote count.

   WHAT COUNTS AS A VOTE COUNT. The data writes "מול", not "בעד/נגד" —
   "עבר 61 מול 55", "עברה בקריאה טרומית 55 מול 10". Both forms are matched
   anyway, because vote_result (beat 5's own field) writes the other one,
   "27 חברי כנסת בעד, 42 נגד", and the CMS has no rule keeping the two
   fields in separate dialects. Verified over every issue in data.js: the
   pattern fires on 14 of the 16 vote_result strings — the two it skips
   have no numbers in them at all — and on exactly 2 of the 16
   bill_summary fields, s1 and s2, in both cases on the last sentence.

   WHEN IT CANNOT CUT CLEANLY IT DOES NOT CUT. If the count sits anywhere
   but the final sentence, the summary is returned whole rather than
   guessed at, and the issue is a content report. No issue is in that state
   today; the branch exists so that a future one is visible instead of
   silently mangled. */

/* ===== P2 · ONE HEIGHT TRANSITION FOR EVERY STICKER CONTENT SWAP =======
   stickerSwap(m, paint) — the ONLY way a .stmodal should change what is
   inside it. Not a profile helper: it takes the modal and a function that
   rewrites the content, and it eases .stmodal__box between the height it
   had and the height that function produces. 2b/2a/2c go through it, the
   invitation's החליפו goes through it, and T34's glossary swap inside
   moreModal() goes through it too — that is what the name is for. Write a
   second one and the two will drift.

   WHY MEASURED PIXELS AND NOT grid-template-rows:0fr->1fr. That technique
   expands a track from NOTHING. None of these moves start at nothing —
   524->376, 183->557 — so expressing one with it means collapsing the old
   content to zero and growing the new from zero: two animations, double
   the time, and a frame in the middle where the sticker has no body. It
   also needs the box converted from flex to grid, which costs
   .bsheet{flex:1 1 auto} — and that flex is the only reason builder axes
   5, 6 and 7 hold at one height across 3, 5 and 6 options. The technique
   would introduce height changes while trying to smooth them.

/* ===== §D · 2c THE BUILDER ============================================
   The CHAR board (v16 canvas, V15CHAR): the preview on its card up top,
   then a kraft sheet with a progress line, ONE axis at a time as a grid
   of white tiles — a mini figure and a name on each — and chevrons at
   the foot. Inside the same sticker 2a and 2b use, content swapped in
   place, so there is one sticker on screen throughout.

   TWO REPRESENTATIONS, ONE ACTIVE. PROFILE.avatarId is the chosen
   preset; PROFILE.cfg is the built character; avatarSvg() ranks cfg
   first. Opening the builder changes NOTHING: `work` is a private copy
   (the saved cfg, or the defaults) and cfg is written only by an axis
   tap or a shuffle — the first such write is the moment the HUD and the
   six consumers switch from preset to build. Open-and-✕ leaves the
   preset active and cfg null. Picking a preset on 2a clears cfg (see
   renderSheet), so both-set never persists.

   THE VOICE STEP. The generator has two bodies and no neutral one, and
   the game never chooses a voice for the player (§B). So when the
   builder opens with no voice set, its FIRST step is the voice question
   — 2b's two chips as tiles showing each body, plus לא משנה, which picks
   one of the two at random and moves on. It writes PROFILE.gender, the
   same field 2b's chips write, and NOT cfg: answering it and closing
   activates no build. If a voice is set the step is not there.

   THE COUNT NEVER LIES because it is never stored: the step list is
   recomputed from the state on every paint — voice (if the builder was
   opened without one), then the six axes less hairColor when the hair is
   קרח. So it reads N מתוך 6, 5 on the bald path, 7 with the voice step,
   and the moment קרח is tapped on the hair axis the line re-reads 5.
   The voice step stays in the list for the whole visit once shown, so
   the count does not jump from 7 to 6 under the player's thumb after
   they answer; prev from the first axis returns to it.

   HAIR COLOUR ON THE HIJAB PATH is the same axis with a different
   heading (BLD_TITLE.hairColorHijab): it colours the scarf, on purpose.

   SHUFFLE is one button, one tap, one result: every axis re-rolled from
   its own list, voice untouched, committed like a tap. No animation
   that rewards a second tap, no sound.

   NO DONE GATE. Every tap already saved. Prev on the first step and the
   ✕ both return to 2b; so does next on the last step (סיימתי), which
   is the same one-way door 2b's שמור is — it closes, it has nothing to
   save — because a chevron that dies on the last step is a dead end. */

/* ===== v26 · THE תכלס TAB AND THE PROMPT'S TAIL =====================
   Both decided on explorations/v26/tachles-tab.html in ~/dev/hachach-121;
   the numbers below are that board's, measured, not estimated.

   THE SPLIT MATCHES THE SUFFIX STRING, NOT THE DASH. Every one of the
   sixteen tachles_prompt values ends with the exact run
   "מה ההצבעה שלך?" and every one is preceded by the identical separator
   "- " (U+002D U+0020) — verified across the whole set. The dash is NOT
   matched on, because dashes occur inside the claims themselves (v2's
   חד-פעמיים, a1's ה 7/10, r1's nothing at all): matching the tail's own
   words is the only rule that cannot cut a claim in half.

   THE DASH STAYS. Everything before the suffix is the claim, dash
   included, so the claim reads "…עבור החרדים-" and the CMS text is
   reproduced character for character. Only trailing WHITESPACE is
   trimmed, and only because a space before a display:block sibling is a
   space at the end of a rendered line. Nothing in data.js changes.

   NO SUFFIX, NO SPLIT. A prompt without the run renders exactly as it
   does today, one line, no tail element — which is the branch the
   fallback string takes, since "מה אתה היית מצביע?" is not the same
   words. That branch is live, not theoretical.

   THE TAIL IS ALWAYS ITS OWN LINE, never inline at any width, which is
   what display:block on .b2q__tail buys. Board measurement: pulling the
   tail out drops the claim a whole 33px line on every prompt long enough
   to have been wrapping, so the block gets SHORTER on three of the four
   cases measured (s1 at both widths, g1 at 360) and taller only where
   the claim was already down to two lines. */
const Q_TAIL = 'מה ההצבעה שלך?';                                       /* TAMAR */

/* T26 · THE SPLIT, FACTORED OUT, because two surfaces now need it and a
   second copy of the suffix test is a second thing to keep in step. The
   rule is unchanged and is the one argued above: match the tail's own
   words as an exact SUFFIX, never the dash, and trim only trailing
   whitespace. A prompt without the run comes back whole. */

  const t = String(text || '');

/* =====================================================================
   T26 · WHAT THE BAND SAYS DURING THE CASCADE, AND THE ONE PLACE IT IS
   DECIDED.

   THIS IS THE FALLBACK, NOT THE FINAL FORM. Tamar's sixteen condensed
   lines do not exist yet, so the band carries the verbatim prompt with
   beat 2's question stripped off it: correct at two lines for eleven of
   the sixteen, truncated for five, and better than showing none of it on
   all sixteen.

   THE SWAP IS A DATA CHANGE. When the condensed strings land they go in
   data.js as one field per issue and this function returns it, falling
   back to today's behaviour for any issue that has not been written yet:

       return issue.tachles_short || promptClaim(issue.tachles_prompt);

   Nothing else moves — not the markup, not the CSS, not the clamp, not
   the call site. See the report.

   THE TAIL COMES OFF HERE AND NOT AT BEAT 2. "מה ההצבעה שלך?" is beat
   2's question and is right where it is asked; on the cascade it is the
   wrong question, asked again under a black tag that is already asking
   the right one, once per card. */
function bandQuestion(iss) {
  if (!iss) return '';
  /* T26b · AND THE HYPHEN GOES WITH IT, HERE AND NOT IN promptClaim().
     v26 ruled the dash stays, and that ruling is about BEAT 2, where the
     tail sits under it on its own line and the dash is what connects the
     claim to it. On this band there is no tail, so the same character is
     a hyphen with nothing after it — on all sixteen, and worst on the
     four that FIT, where r1 renders its complete claim as "…עבור החרדים-"
     and reads truncated on the one issue that is not.
     Band-side only: promptClaim() is shared with beat 2 and is untouched,
     so beat 2 still reads character for character as the CMS wrote it.
     The class covers the ASCII hyphen, the Hebrew maqaf and both dashes,
     because the set is Tamar's to grow and matching one of them would
     have this coming back. */
  return promptClaim(iss.tachles_prompt || '')
           .replace(/[\s\u00A0]*[-\u05BE\u2013\u2014]\s*$/, '');
}

/* v26g · THE TAB IS CENTRED ON THE FIRST WORD OF LINE 1.
   v26f anchored to a fraction of line 1 — 20% along from the start end.
   That guaranteed contact on all sixteen and was still wrong: 20% of a
   340px line is 68px in, past the end of any first word, so fifteen of
   the sixteen landed MID-WORD. g1 covered the middle three letters of
   לאפשר with a letter showing either side, which reads as crossing the
   word out rather than tagging it. Only r1, whose line is the shortest,
   happened to cover a whole word.
   The first word's own box is the only anchor that says "this word".

   WIDER THAN THE WORD IS FINE; HALF OF TWO WORDS IS NOT. When the word
   measures less than the tab the tab overhangs it symmetrically rather
   than shrinking or falling back — a tag wider than the thing it tags
   still reads as a tag. The one clamp is the line's own start end: the
   tab never pushes past it, because a tag hanging off the end of the
   line reads as belonging to nothing.

   ONE EXTRA RANGE, NOT A SECOND LAYOUT PASS. The line-1 rects are still
   read exactly as v26f read them — they are what the clamp needs — and
   the word's box comes from one more Range over the same text node,
   measured in the same batch. Still no ResizeObserver: this hangs off
   the resize stack sizeStage/placeChyron/redrawPath already share, and
   is a no-op on every screen with no .b2q__tab, exactly as redrawPath
   is a no-op with no #mapline. */

/* ===== v27 · BEAT 2 FITS, AND THE CHAIR IS WHAT YIELDS ==============
   THE BUG THIS CLOSES. Beat 2 overflowed 360x640 on fourteen of the
   sixteen issues — g2 by 128px, and on s1 the three vote buttons were
   ENTIRELY off the stage, so the player could not vote. .ov--stage is
   place-items:center inside a stage with overflow:hidden, so the excess
   split top and bottom and was clipped in silence: nothing looked
   broken, the buttons were simply not there.

   A BUDGET, NOT A SCALE. The bottom stack is the interaction and never
   moves: the vote row keeps its 60px and its gap, the question keeps
   whatever height its own text needs, and the padding — safe-area
   included — is identical at every viewport. What is left over is the
   chair, which is decoration. It is measured as a remainder rather than
   re-derived term by term, because the terms are spread across four
   rules and a flex gap and a re-derivation would drift the first time
   one of them moved; the remainder is the same number and cannot.

   ONE PASS IS ENOUGH. The chair's height does not change the column
   width, so the question's line breaks — and therefore the non-chair
   remainder — are identical before and after the resize. There is no
   second reflow to chase.

   THE FLOOR IS 150px. Below that the chair stops being the thing the
   question is about and becomes an icon beside it — which is the exact
   failure ITEM 36's predecessor is on record for at clamp(96px,...).
   At 150 the chair is 129px wide and still reads as a chair: arms,
   cushion and pedestal all survive. If the floor is hit and the screen
   still overflows the chair does NOT squash further — that is a
   content-length problem and it is reported as one. */
const CHAIR_MAX = 330;

/* =====================================================================
   T22 PART 1 · 32px UNDER THE VOTE ROW, MEASURED ON INK.
   The overlay's bottom padding was 16px and the row sat 11.4px clear of
   the stage at 360x640 — close enough to the edge to read as cut off
   rather than as placed. The reservation is 32px of visible ground, and
   like T20's HUD gap it is taken from ink and not from the box: .v-a
   carries a 4.6px extrusion below its border box, so the padding has to
   be 32 + 4.6 to leave 32 of actual air.
   IT COMES OUT OF THE CHAIR, NOT THE QUESTION. avail shrinks, rest does
   not, and the chair is the remainder — which is v27's whole design and
   the reason it can absorb this without anything else moving.
   VOTE_INK is a named constant rather than a parse of computed
   box-shadow, for the reason HUD_INK gives: a shadow string is four
   numbers whose meaning depends on their count, and getting that wrong
   silently is worse than a named 4.6 that a grep for .v-a finds. */

   Three fixed sizes and the largest that fits in three lines. A
   continuously fitted size would give the question a different size on
   every round, which reads as arbitrary rather than as designed — the
   player would see 26 on one issue, 24.3 on the next and have no way to
   understand why. Three steps are a set, and a set reads as a decision.
   THE FLOOR DOES NOT BEND. If an issue still runs to four lines at 20px
   it runs to four lines: going smaller would put the claim under its own
   21px tail and invert the hierarchy, which is a worse failure than a
   fourth line. Those issues are a content-length problem and are named
   in the report rather than absorbed here. */

   T23 · CLEARING A FILLING ANIMATION IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN.

   THE BUG. Three objects leave with the claim card — the card, its stamp
   and the pinned pill — and all three were still holding a fill:both
   animation when they were told to go: d2-jolt-claim, d2-land-mk and
   cmark-land. Each site cleared it the obvious way and then set the exit
   transform in the SAME TICK:

       el.style.animation = 'none';
       el.classList.add('is-leaving');
       el.style.transform = CARD_EXIT_T;

   A CSS animation that is running or filling a property suppresses a
   transition on that property, and the browser only re-evaluates that
   when it computes a style. Nothing forces it to between those three
   lines, so no transform transition was ever created and the objects were
   at translate(-420px,8px) on the first frame after the tap. Measured:
   the card got an opacity transition and nothing else; the stamp and the
   pill got no transitions at all. Everything teleported off screen and
   the only thing that animated was the card's opacity, fading from 1 to
   .2 over 100ms starting at 220ms — an object already 420px off screen.
   That is why the exit was invisible. The 320ms was never the problem and
   is unchanged.

   THE FIX IS THE READ. Touching offsetHeight forces a style and layout
   pass, so the browser computes one state in which the animation is gone
   and the transform is still at rest — which is what the transition then
   has something to travel FROM. It is one line and it is deliberately a
   named function rather than a bare `void el.offsetHeight` at four call
   sites: a forced reflow with no explanation is exactly the line somebody
   deletes as dead code.

   T20 PART 1 · THE TOP OF THE BUDGET, WHICH v27 NEVER HAD.
   v27 reserved from the bottom up — the vote row, the gaps, the padding —
   and let the chair take whatever was left. Nothing reserved from the
   TOP, and .ov--stage is inset:0 over the whole stage with 18px of
   padding, so the column began 18px down while the HUD's painted edge
   ends at 51. The chair's first 33px of box therefore ran behind pills it
   is z-indexed under, on every issue, in every build. e2 only makes it
   obvious because e2's question is the longest and squeezes the chair
   into the space where the overlap shows.

   MEASURED ON INK. Two corrections to the box, both upward:
     · #dcw dilates SourceAlpha by 5 user-space px before compositing the
       white die-cut, so the chair paints 5px ABOVE its own border box.
       That is why the real overlap is 38 and not the 33 a box reading
       gives, and why v27's note says 32.
     · the HUD's pills carry .ib-b's 0 3px 0 extrusion, which paints
       below the HUD's box.
   HUD_INK names the second. It is a constant rather than a parse of
   computed box-shadow because a shadow string is four numbers whose
   meaning depends on their count, and getting that wrong silently is
   worse than a named 3 that a grep for .ib-b finds.

   IT IS COMPUTED, NOT WRITTEN AS A LITERAL. The HUD's own height moves
   with the safe-area inset and with anything that changes the pill row,
   and a literal padding-top would be right on one device. Reading the
   HUD's rect against the stage's costs one measurement in a function

   T27 · THE EXPANDING QUESTION BLOCK.

   IT TAKES THE CENTRE HUD SLOT FROM THE TOPIC PILL, and the topic name
   comes out with it: it is a filing label at the moment filing is
   irrelevant, and the name is already on the map node and on the map the
   player returns to.

   WHERE THE QUESTION MOVED FROM. T26 put it in the chyron as a two-line
   clamp beside the pinned vote. That is what the band is 8px shorter
   without: the chyron falls back to its own 44px min-height and the band
   goes 100 -> 92 at rest, while the question gains a state in which it
   can be read in full — all sixteen prompts, against the two-row clamp's
   six at 360.

   CREAM FILL AND INK TYPE IN BOTH STATES. The HUD's own pill language,
   not the black tag's: the coin pill beside it is cream and the band has
   to read as one family. The transition is height and the fade
   resolving, never a change of surface.

   IT IS ABSOLUTE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON THE ROUND DOES NOT MOVE.
   Expanding in flow would grow .hud and push the card down by the same
   number of pixels on every open. .hud-mid keeps a 36px floor so the row
   is the height it always was, and the panel grows out of it downward
   over the chyron — which is the one thing it is allowed to cover.

   left-to-right inside SVG text — confirmed on device and reproduced in a
   WebKit build here — and no bidi property changes it, so the one route
   that cannot fail is to stop asking SVG to shape Hebrew at all. The disc,
   the two circles and the ink stay SVG; the word is a <span dir="rtl">,
   where bidi is correct in every engine.
   IT IS STILL PRINTED BY THE SAME STAMP. It sits inside .d2, so it lands,
   scales and rotates with the disc as one object; it takes the disc's
   currentColor and the display face at 900; and it carries #ink-h, which
   is #ink rescaled to CSS px, driven off the same clock by inkBleed(). It
   is not type layered on a graphic — it is the same ink.

   THE RING TEXT IS GONE, keeping the ring as a graphic band. Curved text
   has no HTML equivalent that does not hand-place glyphs in visual order,
   which is the source-string reversal we are refusing; leaving it as SVG
   would leave it reversed on iOS. An illegible ring is worse than none.

   and the narrowness is load-bearing, so here is the exact blast radius,
   because the next person to edit this constant will need it:
     · stamp(ok) with no override is called from TWO places, and both are
       the SAME OBJECT — the disc on an MK card. cascade verdict() and the
       inverted round's invResolve(). That is the sanctioned surface.
     · the claim reveal calls stamp(ok, truth) and passes אמת / שקר /

     · the verdict PILL is CLAIM_MARK, a different constant on a different
       object. T6c · IT NOW CARRIES THE IDENTICAL PAIR — Lion's decision
       of 09 Sep, which widened the exception from one surface to two.
       The two constants are still SEPARATE, and deliberately: they are
       different objects on different planes, and one of them can be
       retuned without the other. If the pair is ever changed, change it
       in BOTH or the round speaks in two voices again — which is the
       thing T6c existed to fix.
     · the finale, the record and the share card are NOT included. The
       surprise framing is intact on all three and they were never fed by
       either constant.
   DO NOT GENERALISE THIS. Two surfaces is where Lion stopped it. A third
   is a new decision by him, not an extension of this one.
   THE PAIR MATCHES. The first pass of T6 left "צדקת" bare against a
   "טעית!" that had just gained a mark, which read as one of the two
   having been edited and the other forgotten — an exclamation is a
   loudness, and only one side was loud. Tamar closed it on 09 Sep.
   BOTH SIDES OR NEITHER, if this is ever retuned: these two strings are
   the same object in two states and the mark is part of the register,
   not part of the verdict. T6c · AND THE PILL IS NOW A THIRD AND FOURTH

/* ===== THE SEAT GRID · v20 option 4 ==================================
   THE TITLE, AS A PICTURE. 120 blocks and one more that is the player.
   The civic point of the whole product — you are one seat among 120 —
   delivered as an image instead of a sentence, which is why nothing else
   on this screen may out-weigh it.

   NOT A SEATING CHART, and that is a factual constraint rather than a
   stylistic one. The real chamber is seated by faction, we cannot source
   a true layout, and anything that implied one would be a claim we cannot
   stand behind. So: abstract blocks, an arbitrary 15x8 rectangle, no
   grouping by party, no hemicycle. The order carries no meaning beyond
   "how many".

   THE PLAYER'S SEAT IS THE 121st AND SITS APART, on its own row under the
   120. That is the literal reading of the title and it is also what keeps
   it visible in the empty state, where every other block is dark.

   WHY IT IS CODED BY SHAPE AND NOT BY HUE. It must never be coloured as
   either side. Both side hues are taken, the two correctness hues are
   forbidden, the chyron's cyan is on screen at this beat, and the only
   remaining candidate — --primary yellow — sits dE 21.6 from the נגד
   ecru, which is too close for two squares in one grid. So it is the only
   ROUND block, the only one with a keyline, and the only one set apart.
   Form does the work that hue cannot, and the yellow is then free to say
   "you" the way it does everywhere else in the system.

   THE REMAINDER IS HONEST. for + against does not reach 120 on three of
   the four issues that have a tally — a1 is 53+48 = 101 — and the other
   19 are simply not in the record. They stay dark. Nothing here invents an
   abstention or an absence it was not given. */
/* ===================== §S-1 · THE FINALE ============================
   THE 11x11 SEAT GRID IS REJECTED AND GONE — seatPlan(), seatBoard() and
   runTally() with it. On the record: the interleaved fill was a
   constraint set to avoid implying factional seating, and it worked, but
   it produced a checkerboard nobody can read a majority off. Honest and
   illegible. What replaces it is V20-2's family — two numbers, left and
   right, a bar between, counting up — plus the move the grid could never
   make: the player's own token flying to the side they voted for. The
   121st-MK conceit is delivered by an ACTION rather than by a dot in a
   grid.

   THE BEAT IS A SEQUENCE, NOT A SCREEN, and that is the whole design.
   It had been drawn three times as a static layout and each read as
   chaotic, because everything arrived at once with no order of
   importance. Four rules govern the order:
     - the TALLY is the peak, and NOTHING else may land while it counts
     - the FLIGHT is a second beat, watchable, never simultaneous
     - the COINS get a moment of their own
     - the BUTTONS arrive last and nothing lands after them

   Splitting naively on the first full stop therefore puts 'זה נכון!' on
   screen at beat 5 — two words that say nothing, and that re-answer a
   question resolved four beats earlier. Measured across the eleven
   active issues, six of them open with exactly that.

/* ===================== 4.5 · THE PRE-REVEAL =========================
   ITEM 32. A held screen between the last MK card and the finale: the
   cascade has ended, nothing has been revealed, and the player presses to
   see the result. It exists so the reveal is something they ASK for
   rather than something that arrives while the last card is still
   leaving.

   T11 · WHAT THE SCREEN IS NOW. The last card flies off and what is left
   is THE GROUND — the same charcoal dot-grid surface that has been behind
   the deck since the round opened. Not a panel on the ground and not a
   card-shaped object on it: nothing is drawn here at all, because the
   surface is already painted by #stage and .stage::before and every
   container between a card and the stage is transparent. The deck's exit
   is therefore the whole reveal; there is nothing to uncover and nothing
   to fade in behind it.

   TWO THINGS ON IT, AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT LIFETIMES.
     · THE GATE IS EVERY ROUND. It is the press that asks for the result
       and the round does not advance without it.
     · THE EXPLANATION IS ONCE EVER. It answers "what is about to happen"
       and that question is only asked the first time. PRE_HOW_SEEN is
       written when it is SHOWN, not when the gate is pressed — the same
       contract maybeMapIntro() uses — because a player who reads it and
       leaves has still read it.
   Those two are deliberately not one condition. Gating the whole screen
   on the flag would delete the press, and the press is the item.

   NO CONFETTI AND NO COUNT-UP. Both belong elsewhere and both are locked:
   confetti to 8/8 map completion, the count to the finale board. This
   screen holds still.

   BOTH STRINGS ARE WRITTEN. The hazard placeholder this screen used to
   carry is gone: Tamar's line is the EXPLANATION and לתוצאות › is the
   button, which is the way round they were always meant to be. .pr-ph is
   no longer used here — it still exists for beat 3's unwritten line and
   is untouched.

   S.beat is 4.5 on purpose: exitRound() treats > 1 and < 5 as mid-round,
   so leaving here still asks for confirmation, which is right — the
   record is written by beat 5 and nothing is saved yet. */

   T22 · THE PRE-REVEAL'S CHAIR BUDGET, AND IT IS v27's, NOT A NEW ONE.
   Same shape as fitBeat2(): the bottom of the column is the interaction
   and never moves — the gate keeps its height, the explanation keeps
   whatever its two lines need, the gaps are the gaps — and the chair is
   the remainder. Measured as a remainder rather than re-derived term by
   term, for the reason v27 gives: the terms are spread across a rule and
   a flex gap, and a re-derivation drifts the first time one of them
   moves while the remainder cannot.

   THE FLOOR IS v27's 150px, DELIBERATELY THE SAME NUMBER. Below it the
   chair stops being the thing the screen is about and becomes an icon
   beside a button, which is the failure that floor is on record for. If
   the remainder comes in under it the chair does NOT squash further — it
   takes the floor and the column absorbs the difference, which on this
   screen it can because the column is centred with slack rather than
   packed like beat 2's.

   THE CEILING IS 210, NOT BEAT 2's 330. This is a callback, not a
   reprise: at beat 2's size the same object twice in ninety seconds
   reads as the same screen returning, and the gate stops being the thing
   the eye lands on. 210 is comfortably a chair — beat 2 itself runs down
   to 180 on the long questions — and comfortably not beat 2's.

   IT CANNOT REACH THE HUD, and that is structural rather than computed
   here. This beat lives inside .round, which is a flex sibling BELOW the
   HUD in the stage's column; beat 2's chair could only ever pass behind
   the pills because its overlay is inset:0 over the whole stage. The
   clearance is measured in the report against T20's 14px rule and comes

   T19 · THE PROGRESS PILL JOINS THE COIN PILL, AND IT IS MOVED FROM HERE

   faded its three parts up on an empty ground. So the last card left, the
   round went black for the length of one frame, and a screen ARRIVED —
   two events with a join in them. That is the opposite of the reading

   fade: the three parts lose .b5stage entirely.

   THE STACKING. .round is a flex column and .beat is flex:1, so two beats
   would sit one above the other. .has-gate switches .round to a one-cell
   grid and puts both beats in that cell, which is the SAME BOX flex:1
   gave them — that is the whole reason it is a grid and not an absolute
   inset, which would have resolved against the padding box and dropped
   the gate 26px. So there is no reflow when the deck goes and the class
   comes off: the gate's box is identical before and after.
   UNDER MEANS UNDER. .is-under takes z-index 0 against the cascade's 1

   rgb(255,214,10) at 200x34 with peak 26. The one thing that is NOT the
   poster's is the row table, and that is deliberate -- see below.

   FIVE ROWS, NOT SIX, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS THE ARGUMENT. The poster
   runs [214,14] [266,18] [318,22] [370,26] [422,30] [474,10]: six rows
   at ~30px pitch across radii 214-474 want 148 seats, the field must be
   120, so a short sixth of ten finishes the count on a 331px stub of arc
   above an 869px one. At 360 that reads as ten seats set apart from 110,
   which is the one thing in this whole surface that is mistakable for a
   bloc. 16/20/24/28/32 is exactly 120 with every row at the full 118
   degrees and every pitch within 1.35px of every other -- measured
   28.04 to 29.38 -- and the field gets shallower with it (outer arc 474
   -> 422), which at 360 stops it crowding the chair.s shoulders.
   THE POSTER IS NOT CHANGED. It now diverges from the game surface, and
   that is expected: the same twelve numbers in p4() would have to move
   to match, and the poster is shipped work.

   THE 121st IS NOT A GAP IN THE FIELD. Nothing is missing, marked,
   removed or left empty -- an empty slot among 120 filled ones is a
   diagram of an outcome, and the field must not be one. It is LIT FLOOR:
   the pool is the player.s own yellow and the thing standing in it is
   the chair. The empty seat is expressed as light.

   THE GUARDRAIL, AND IT IS A CONSTRAINT ON THE DRAWING, NOT A NOTE:
   one fill, one outline, one size across all 120. No hue on any seat.
   No grouping, no ordering, no spacing that could read as a side. The
   only colour anywhere in this function is the player.s yellow, as light
   on the floor, and it never touches a seat. If a future change puts a
   second fill in here, that change is wrong.

     record being cleared away to make room for the reading, one beat
     after the whole beat was built to make the record the loudest thing
     on screen. It now holds its full size and RISES to its final place
     instead, and the reading and the buttons come up from underneath it.
     THE ORDER IS INVERTED, and that is the substantive change rather
     than the class that is no longer added. Every block used to arrive
     first, each one re-measuring and nudging the column, and the eased
     re-centre ran last to clean up after them. Now all of them are in
     the DOM and in layout — held at opacity 0 — BEFORE anything moves,
     so f5Place() measures the final stack once, the board makes one
     eased move to a value that is already correct, and the panels fade
     up behind it on the stagger. Nothing is measured while it moves and
     nothing moves after the measurement.

     were in the DOM it read 868px of stack against 786 of room and

     retargeted the padding and the next call put it back. A 9.5% flash

/* ---- ITEM 11 · THE 121ST VOTE IS COUNTED ---------------------------
   The board has said what the Knesset did. This is the only moment in the
   game where the player's own vote is added to it, and all three things
   that say so move together on one 220ms curve: the numeral ticks, the
   numeral goes gold, and the bar segment grows by one unit of its own
   scale.

   IT DERIVES FROM THE SAME PLACE THE COUNT DOES. `tally` is the object
   beat5() reads out of issue._tally and hands to runCount() — one source,
   passed in, never re-read from the DOM and never a second field name. If
   the CMS reconciliation moves the board onto tally_for/tally_against,
   beat5()'s single read moves with it and this follows for free. Reading
   the numeral's own text back off the screen would have been the other
   option and it is worse: it makes the animation depend on a rendering
   rather than on the record.

   THE 61 MARKER DOES NOT MOVE, and there is no branch here that could
   move it. A +1 that crosses 61 gets exactly what a +1 that does not
   gets. No issue in the data reaches it — the closest is s1, which is
   already ON 61 — but the rule is structural, not a fact about the data.

   no side to add to; the token has already landed on the majority line,

   THE PROGRESS MODEL · §3.2, and the one place the data did not answer.

   WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN data.js: 16 issues, exactly 2 per topic, and ONE
   boolean — `core`. It is true on the first issue of every topic and false
   on the second. There is no third issue anywhere and no field that says
   "bonus". So the fields available to distinguish a bonus issue from a
   non-bonus one are: `core`, and nothing else.

   THE TWO READINGS OF `core:false`, and they are incompatible:
     app.js  treats it as THE BONUS. x/8 counts core issues only
             (app.js:248-251, doneCore/totalCore), and the topic-complete
             screen offers the other issue as "סוגיית בונוס" (app.js:546).
             Under that reading, finishing s1 alone would read 1/8.
     the sheet  §0.2 says "8 topics x 2 סוגיות = 16 rounds, PLUS bonus
             סוגיות per topic", and §3.2 puts one ring segment per סוגיה
             with bonus explicitly outside the ring. Under that reading
             BOTH issues are ring segments and the bonus is a third thing
             that has not been written yet.

   THE SHEET WINS — the brief says so where the sources disagree, and the
   state the brief asks to see confirms it: complete s1, and the node shows
   1 of 2 segments while the headline still reads 0/8. That is only true if
   s2 is a segment rather than the bonus.

   RESOLVED BY THE SHEET. Tamar's set has eleven issues over six topics and
   no bonus among them, so the concept is gone rather than stubbed: no
   marker, no seam, no demo flag. `core` no longer decides anything here —
   it has been reassigned to "first ACTIVE issue in the topic" purely so
   app.js's derived progress maths keeps working, and this file orders by
   array position instead.
   ===================================================================== */

   THE SAVE · ONE KEY, ONE VERSION, AND ONLY WHAT THE END-GAME READS.

   WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. PROGRESS and the wallet were session-only by
   choice, and the choice was right while the game ended by looping back
   to the map. It stops being right the moment there is an end-game: a
   player who reloads on issue 9 of 11 loses the run, and the end-game is
   the one screen whose whole content is the run.

   WHAT IS STORED, AND WHY EACH FIELD EARNS ITS PLACE. Nothing here is
   speculative — every field is read by a beat that is specified:
     wallet          the coins to allocate                    (beat 3)
     progress        which issues are done; the map, and the
                     completion test topicsDone() === TOPICS().length
     record[id].claim   did the claim surprise them           (beats 2, 4)
     record[id].pos     their own vote, for the alignment line (beat 2)
     record[id].hits    correct MK predictions this round     (beats 2, 4)
     record[id].cards   how many were asked, so `hits` has a
                        denominator that is not re-derived later
     cf              whether the one celebration has been spent
   The surprise count is (claim ? 0 : 1) + (cards - hits), summed. The
   alignment record compares `pos` to _tally, which lives in data.js and
   is therefore never stored.

   WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT STORED. No timings. No per-MK answer history:
   WHICH member was missed is answer history, the counts are the beat's
   content, and only the counts are kept. No analytics of any kind. No
   avatar, no settings — the DEV switches are URL state and stay that way.

   repaired, because a half-trusted save is how a broken map gets
   rendered:

     2 · an issue id that is not in DATA — the content set moved and the
         progress no longer describes anything real
     3 · anything malformed — not an object, wallet not a finite number

/* ===== A4 · THE WAY OUT OF A ROUND ==================================
   On beat 1 nothing has been answered and on the final reveal everything
   has, so both leave immediately — a confirm there would be asking the
   player to approve throwing away nothing. In between there is real
   progress that is not saved, so it asks.

   B5-1, BUILT, AND CENTRED IN BOTH AXES. The board drew it as a sheet at
   the foot; §3.3 centres it horizontally AND vertically instead, which is
   what a destructive confirm should do — a bottom sheet is the shape of
   an options menu, and this is not one. It is the same die-cut sticker
   the law modal is, on the same dimmed ground, so the round has exactly
   one modal shape rather than one for content and another for confirms.

   THE QUESTION AND THE CONSEQUENCE ARE TWO LINES NOW. They used to be one
   string doing both jobs — "לצאת מהסוגיה? ההתקדמות בה לא תישמר" — which
   made the consequence read as part of the question rather than as the
   thing the player is agreeing to. §3.3 splits them: the question in
   black at body size, the consequence under it, quieter.

   THREE WAYS TO STAY and one to leave. The ✕, the ground and להישאר all
   dismiss; only לצאת goes. That asymmetry is deliberate — every ambiguous
   gesture resolves toward not losing the round.

   T27b · THE CONFIRM, FACTORED OUT.

   ONE SHAPE FOR EVERY DESTRUCTIVE ASK. .exitsheet was already the app's
   answer to this question and its own note says why it is centred in
   both axes rather than a bottom sheet: "a bottom sheet is the shape of
   an options menu, and this is not one." The allocation's restart is the
   second thing in the app that cannot be undone, so it gets the same
   object rather than a second modal shape.

   THREE WAYS TO CANCEL AND ONE TO PROCEED, unchanged from the round's:
   the ✕, the ground and the stay button all dismiss; only `go` goes.
   Every ambiguous gesture resolves toward not losing the thing.

   T35c · THE YELLOW IS NOT IN THE SAME PLACE ON ALL THREE SHEETS, AND
   THAT ASYMMETRY IS THE DESIGN. Do not "fix" it into consistency.
     · This sheet — leaving a round, restarting an allocation — puts the
       DESTRUCTIVE verb on the primary. What is lost is one round or one
       screen's worth of taps, both of which the player can simply do
       again, so the sheet's job is to confirm quickly and get out of the
       way.
     · resetConfirm() — the whole game — inverts it: .rs__safe (keep
       playing) is the yellow primary and .rs__go (wipe) is demoted below
       the perforation, ringed and unlifted. What is lost there is the
       whole run and it cannot be re-earned.
   The rule the pair encodes: THE MORE SEVERE THE LOSS, THE MORE THE
   PRIMARY DEFENDS AGAINST IT. A sheet whose yellow always meant "yes"
   would make the gravest button in the game the easiest one to hit.
   The HEAD is the half that is shared — same box, same ✕, same centred
   title and consequence line as of T35c. The FOOT is where the two

/* ===================== §1 · THE LOADING BEAT ========================
   The intro empties, the chair grows into the middle, a bar fills under
   it, and then the destination.

   THE DESTINATION IS AN ARGUMENT. Today the only caller passes goMap;
   when character creation lands between them it passes that instead, and
   nothing in here changes. The beat deliberately knows nothing about
   where it is going — it is a transition, not a router.

   THE BAR IS FAKE AND THE CODE SHOULD NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE. Nothing is
   being fetched, decoded or waited on: the fill runs on --t-load-fill and
   that is the entire mechanism. When there IS something to load, that
   clock is what gets replaced with the real signal; the shape of the
   beat, the copy and the geometry all survive it.

   NO LABEL UNDER THE BAR, and it was a real choice between 'טוען את
   הכנסת…' and nothing:
     - the bar is fake, and a label naming the work asserts something that
       is not happening. When it becomes true it will be true for a
       different reason, which is a bad thing for shipped copy to be
       waiting on.
     - the beat exists to go from four objects on screen to ONE. Adding a
       third element back — chair, bar, line — undoes the reduction that
       is the entire point of it.
     - it is on screen for 2.2 seconds. Nobody reads it, and a Hebrew line
       nobody reads is still a Hebrew line somebody has to write, review
       and translate.
   The chair and a cyan bar already say wait. What a label WOULD have
   carried is the accessible name, so that goes on the element itself as
   role=progressbar + aria-label: announced, never drawn.

   prefers-reduced-motion SKIPS THE WHOLE BEAT rather than shortening it.
   A 2.2s wait with no motion is just a delay, and a delay is the one
   thing this is not allowed to be. */

/* §1.1 WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A MASK, and why that is the structural fix
   rather than the cosmetic one.

   The mask punched a hole of r = --ring-r at every node centre, so the
   ribbon ended on the ring's CENTRELINE and the ring stroke was supposed
   to cover the cut. Two things made that fail, and neither is tunable:
     · the segments have the board's 27.2-degree gaps in them, and for a
       two-issue topic those gaps land at the TOP and the BOTTOM of the
       ring — exactly where the ribbon arrives. There is no stroke there
       to cover anything, at any weight.
     · inside the ring's inner edge the ground is charcoal, and the mask
       had removed the ribbon from all of it. So even where the stroke did
       cover the cut, the annulus between the disc and the ring showed
       charcoal where the road should have been.
   Thickening the stroke (the third option in the brief) fixes neither: it
   narrows the annulus without closing it and does nothing about the gaps.
   Shrinking the hole to the disc's radius (the first) fixes both, but it
   leaves a mask whose radius has to be kept in step with --node-face and
   --node-depth by hand, and a hole that is a few px too large puts the
   charcoal ring straight back.

   So the mask is gone. The ribbon is one uncut path and the DISC covers
   it — .node is z-index 2 over .path-line's 1, which was already true and
   is now the only thing doing the work. The path cannot read as severed
   because it is not cut, and there is no second radius to drift.

   WHAT IS NOW VISIBLE INSIDE THE RING is the ribbon itself, crossing the
   7px of open ground between the disc and the ring at the top and bottom
   of every node. That is the road passing behind the node, which is what
   it should look like, and it is only legible at all because 1.4 pulled
   the ring back in — at the 18.5px stand-off the old overhang forced, the
   same ribbon read as a bar across the gap. */

/* ===== A4b · THE ROUND IS UNMOUNTED, NOT HIDDEN ======================
   showScreen() toggles `hidden` on the four .screen sections and on the
   chyron, and that is all it knows about. The beat-2/3 surface is not one
   of them: .ov--stage is a child of #stage — it has to be, or the blur
   stops at .round's padding and the dot grid shows through at every
   border — so hiding the round left the chair, the prompt and the three
   vote chips painted over the map at z-index 9, above everything the map
   draws, with their handlers still attached. Its only removal was its own
   beat-3 dismiss tap, which is a tap the player who just left the round
   is by definition not going to make.

   REMOVING THAT ONE NODE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SYMPTOM'S FIX. What was
   actually wrong is that a round had no teardown at all: S kept the
   abandoned round's beat, position and guesses until the next newRound()
   happened to overwrite it, #round kept the whole beat's DOM behind the
   hidden screen, the chyron kept whatever the last beat pinned in it, and
   the inverted round's step timers kept firing against a round that no
   longer exists. This is that teardown, and it is the ONE place that
   knows what a round parents outside itself.

   S IS SET TO NULL, NOT EMPTIED. Every reader of it either runs inside a
   round or already guards (exitRound), and a null is what makes a stale
   timer's `S.phase` test fail outright instead of quietly passing against
   the dead round's state.

   .stmodal[data-profile] IS NOT A ROUND'S. It is the map's character

/* ===================== SOUND · THE TOGGLE ============================
   IT SHIPS WITH THE FIRST SOUND, never after: with sound off by default
   this control is the only way anyone learns sound exists at all.

   NOT IN THE HUD, AND BOTTOM-LEFT. The HUD's three slots are the coin
   chip, the count and the avatar, and all three are subject matter; this
   is a setting. The corner is free on both screens it appears on — the
   map bar's own pill starts at x=112 and the round's card foot ends at
   y=791, against a 44px target at [12,786].

   MAP AND ROUNDS ONLY, and that is the app's own rule rather than a new
   one. .stage.is-ending .hud{display:none} already takes the coin chip
   and the progress pill off for the whole ending because they are round
   chrome and the round is over. A control governing sounds that only
   fire in a round is round chrome by the same test, so it goes with them
   and comes back with them on goMap().

   ARMED FROM THE ROUTER, exactly as T13's beacon is. showScreen() is the
   only code that knows which screen is up, which is what makes "never
   left on a screen it does not belong to" a property of the code rather
   than a promise. See syncAvBeacon() directly above — this is the same
   mechanism, not a second one.

   THE RESTING STATE IS THE SLASHED SPEAKER because sound is off, and the
   slash is the true state rather than a warning. It also reads as an
   invitation in a way a plain speaker does not.

   FULL WHITE ON THE MAP, 0.7 EVERYWHERE ELSE. Measured: the map's ground
   under this corner is #E4752C and pure white is 3.05:1 against it, so
   every reduction fails there and the map gets 1.0. The round's ground is
   --ground #2B2926, where 0.7 white is 7.9:1 and the toggle can afford to
   be quiet. The opacity is per-screen in CSS; there is no plate and no
   new object.

   ONE ARC ON, NOT THREE. At 20px the outermost of three concentric arcs
   sits 2px from the box edge and the set smears; the slashed state is the
   more legible of the two because the slash REPLACES the arcs rather than
   adding to them. So the on-state carries one. */

   button at [16,543,97x60] — they overlap by 40x21px, and hit-testing
   that region returns the TOGGLE. A player aiming at the bottom-left of
   נגד mutes the game instead of voting against the bill. At 390x844 the

   §E · THE END-GAME, FIVE BEATS.

   WHAT IT REPLACES. The terminal state used to be a loop: beat 5's exit
   was a per-topic question, so the last issue of the last topic fell
   through to חזרה למפה, the map read 6/6, and tapping any node replayed
   it (openTopic's `|| topicIssues(id)[0]` fallback). Nothing in the game
   could say it was over. gameDone() says it now.

   EVERY NUMBER ON THIS SCREEN IS DERIVED, and derived HERE. There is no
   stored total anywhere: endStats() reads RECORD — written one round at
   a time by beat 5 — and data.js, on every entry. Re-cut the content and
   the end-game re-counts. That is why the brief's own example figures
   (11 surprises, 5 of 8) appear nowhere in this file: they were written
   against the 16-round set and would be a lie on this one.

   THE FIVE BEATS ARE FOUR SCREENS. Beats 4 and 5 share one, because
   "the buttons arrive last and stay" is a statement about the card's
   screen — the exits arrive under the card and do not replace it.
   ===================================================================== */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE DERIVATIONS.

   A SURPRISE IS A PREDICTION REALITY DID NOT MATCH, and both kinds
   count: the claim at beat 1 and every MK at beat 4. That makes the
   arithmetic closed — asked = correct + surprises — so the share card
   and the record screen can never disagree, which is the §0.4 rule
   about the game never lying about its own numbers.

   THE ALIGNMENT DENOMINATOR IS THE ISSUES THAT CARRY A VOTE COUNT, and
   it is small on purpose: only 4 of the 11 active issues have _tally, so
   only 4 have a documented outcome to compare a position against. The
   alternative — inferring a direction from some other field — would
   invent an outcome the data does not state, on a product whose whole
   credibility is documented votes. So the number stays 4 and the COPY
   says what the 4 is.
   AN ABSTENTION IS COUNTED AND NEVER MATCHES. Dropping נמנע from the
   denominator would make it move per player and the sentence stop being
   checkable; keeping it is also just true — an abstention is not a vote
   with the majority.
   HARD GUARDRAIL (§1.4c, sheet p.11): the comparison is to WHAT
   HAPPENED, never to who the player resembles. There is no party, bloc
   or MK anywhere in this section, and there must never be one.

   WHAT IT REPLACES. Screens 1 and 2 were an overlay over the blurred
   finale board; 3 and 4 were surfaces on #scEnd. The player crossed from
   one environment into another halfway through an ending that is supposed
   to be one thing, which is the whole of Lion's note.

   THE KEYBOARD OBJECTION DID NOT SURVIVE THE TEST, and it turned out to
   be pointing the wrong way. Measured with a 336px iOS keyboard driven
   exactly as kbSync() drives it, the SURFACE moved the free-text field by
   0px and left it 182.9px under the keyboard at 390x844 and 150.9px under
   at 360x640 — and the list could not be scrolled to rescue it, because
   the scroller's own box is under the keyboard too. §N says why in its
   first paragraph: --vh mirrors window.innerHeight, and window.innerHeight
   does not change on iOS when the keyboard opens. A flex surface sized to
   it does not re-lay-out either.
   WHAT DOES WORK IS CONSUMING --kb-h, and the app already ships that: the
   2b profile sheet is an absolutely-positioned overlay with a text field
   in it, and it survives the keyboard because .stmodal pads its foot by
   --kb-h and caps its box at --kb-vis. .ov--end does the same now. The
   overlay is not merely safe here — it is the repair.

   ONE OVERLAY, FOUR CONTENTS. Screens 1 and 2 are the posed column;

   BEAT 1 · THE CONFETTI.

   THE ONLY CONFETTI IN THE GAME. It was cut from every per-round reveal

   3/5, and it covered the results table. Both are answered here by the
   same two rules — it fires ONCE, on completing the map, and it lands

   and sits at a lower z-index, so the pieces fall BEHIND the words. That
   is a stacking fact rather than a timing promise: even if the copy grew
   or the beat were re-ordered, the payload cannot be covered.

   NOT THE SIX TOPIC HUES. Cycling the topic palette would draw a rainbow
   across the screen, which is the exact thing lsGlyph() rejected on the
   title for a reason that has not changed: in Israel a rainbow reads as
   a pride symbol, one of the six live topics is מגדר ושוויון, and a
   celebration is the last place to make an unintended political
   statement. The pieces take the app's own neutrals and the coin's gold.

   frame of the transition IS screen 2 rather than a drawing that
   resembles it. That is the .ovpane argument two blocks up in the
   stylesheet, applied to a longer move: two overlays would be two blurs
   and the seam reads as a load.

   THE LAST SCREEN STAYS BEHIND IT. #scRound is not hidden while this is
   up — the finale board the player has just finished is what the blur is
   blurring, which is what makes the overlay read as an interruption
   rather than a navigation. It is hidden at the collapse, not before.

   THE OVERLAY COVERS THE HUD, and it is the only surface in the app that
   does: .ov--end takes z-index 13 against the HUD's 12. Beat 2's
   .ov--stage is 9 and has ALWAYS sat under the HUD — see the report; it
   is not changed here, because that would change every round.

   the strip's spread: the board drew six because the sheet leaves six,
   and TOPICS() is read live everywhere else in this file. rows is
   ceil(n/2) and the strip is centred on (n-1)/2 steps, which reproduces

   T25 · THE ROW PITCH IS MEASURED, AND IT USED TO BE A COLLISION.

   EG_ROW was a flat 84 against a 74px node, so a row had 10px between one
   node's foot and the next node's head — and .egn__lab sits in that 10px
   with a 4px margin and a 13.2px line. Measured: every label overlapped
   the ring below it by 7.3px, on all three rows, not only the one that
   wraps. It was not a crowding problem, it was an overlap.

   PER ROW, NOT ONE PITCH. Only אחריות ציבורית wraps today and it happens
   to sit in the last row, where there is nothing under it. Reserving two
   lines on every row to cover that would spend 13px three times for one
   label. Each row is given the height its OWN tallest label needs, so a
   re-cut content set that puts a long label in row 0 gets the room there
   and nowhere else.
   THE AIR IS NAMED. EG_ROW_AIR is the clear space between a label's foot
   and the next ring, and it is the number to argue with if this still

   THE ONE FUNCTION.

   egPose(0) is screen 1. egPose(1) is screen 2. Nothing else draws
   either of them, so they cannot drift apart and the handoff cannot
   arrive somewhere the destination is not.

   SIX ELEMENTS, SIX TRANSFORMS, ONE DURATION. The 2x3 grid becoming a
   1x6 letterhead is a REFLOW, and a reflow mid-transition reads as a
   cut — which is why the nodes are absolutely positioned and moved by
   transform rather than laid out by the grid at either end.

   THE STAGGER IS BETWEEN THE FOUR THINGS THAT MOVE, not between the six
   nodes: labels out over the first 90ms, the grid unfolding across the
   whole 360, the chair from 65ms, the document from 165ms. All four are
   sampled from the same e, so there is no gap anywhere to read as a
   second beat.

   EVERYTHING TRAVELS UP. The grid's rows rise to one line, the chair
   rises from below, the document follows the chair. The unfold does add
   a horizontal component — the outer nodes spread sideways as they rise,
   so four of the six paths are diagonal. That is Lion's call and it is
   kept: the vertical term is the larger one at every frame, and the
   spread RESOLVES onto a single line, which is a more legible
   destination than six arriving in a smaller copy of where they began.

   BEAT 3 · THE ALLOCATION.

   THE TARGETS ARE THE GAME'S OWN TOPICS, and that is the whole argument
   (§0.3b): a curated list of "legitimate causes" is itself an editorial
   act — who decided ביטחון counts and זכויות עובדים does not — and the
   six topics the player has just spent eleven rounds inside sidestep it
   entirely. TOPICS() is read live, so a re-cut content set re-cuts this
   screen and nothing here has to be told.

   CHIPS AND A SIMPLE SPLIT, NOT A SLIDER. The sheet's minimal v1
   (p.4, option b) verbatim. A tap adds one portion; the portion is a
   tenth of what was earned, rounded to the game's own 25-coin unit, so
   the numbers on screen stay in the vocabulary the round taught.

   EVERY COIN IS ALLOCATABLE. The last portion is whatever is left rather
   than a fixed step — without that, a 1,900 wallet and a 200 step strand
   100 coins nobody can place, which would make "distribute your coins" a
   promise the screen does not keep. That was the original build's whole
   failure and it is not being repeated in a new shape.

   LEAVING COINS UNSPENT IS A VALID END STATE. The continue button is
   never gated on a full allocation: this is a statement of priorities,
   not a puzzle with a solution, and a completion gate would turn it into
   one. NO SCARCITY, NO TIMER, NO PRESSURE COPY.

   THE HUD CHIP DOES NOT MOVE. It keeps showing what was earned, because
   that is a fact about the run; what is left to place is this screen's
   own line. Spending out of the HUD would also mean writing a smaller
   number into the save, and the save records the run, not this screen.

   ITEM 14 · THE COINS GO WHERE THE PLAYER PUT THEM
   Feedback only. Nothing here reads or writes ALLOC, egPortion() or the
   totals — the allocation is exactly the line it always was and this is
   layered over it.

   THE ROW'S NUMBER WAITS FOR THE COINS. That is the whole point of the
   item and it is the one thing here that touches the render: the tap
   moves the state immediately (so the balance is honest and a second tap
   is charged correctly), but the ROW keeps showing what it was showing
   until the first token lands. Without that the number changes on tap and
   the flight is decoration arriving after the fact.
   The hold is a data attribute on the chip rather than a variable,
   because egPaint() is the one painter and it has to be able to see it.

   THREE FLIGHTS, NEVER A QUEUE. A fourth tap inside the window gets no
   sprites at all — it decrements, it increments, and it is done. Nothing
   is buffered: a backlog would land coins seconds after the tap that
   bought them, which is worse than no coins.

   prefers-reduced-motion: no sprites and no pulse. The row is then never

/* =====================================================================
   THE FADE · SECOND CALL SITE OF THE REVEAL PANEL'S, NOT A NEW IDEA.
   Same two classes and the same test as the MK card's explanation block:
   .has-more only while the block ACTUALLY overflows, .is-atend clearing
   it at the bottom of the scroll, so a fully-scrolled list and a list
   with nothing hidden both end on a hard edge rather than on a permanent
   decorative shadow. The mask itself is in proto.css beside .eg-chips.

   WHY IT IS A FUNCTION AND NOT A CLOSURE INSIDE egBeat3(). The reveal
   panel is built once and never changes size, so its sync can run at
   build and on scroll and be done. This list changes size AFTER it is
   built, twice: the reset link appears on the first tap and takes 41px
   off the list, and the free-text row grows the content again. Both go
   through egPaint(), which is already the one place that runs on every
   change to this screen, so the test lives where it can be called from
   there rather than being reachable only from the builder's scope.

   IT MEASURES, IT DOES NOT REMEMBER. Reading clientHeight straight after
   egPaint() toggles the reset link forces the layout that toggle just
   invalidated, which is exactly what is wanted: the answer is about the
   list as it is now, not as it was before the link arrived. */
/* T21 · ONE SYNC FOR EVERY .edgefade, and it is this one. The MK reveal
   panel had a second copy of it as a closure, toggling the same two class
   names on a different node against the same arithmetic; that copy is
   gone. Anything that scrolls calls this, on build and on scroll.
   IT WRITES TO THE ELEMENT IT MEASURES. The reveal panel's copy wrote to
   the scroller's PARENT because its mask was a descendant selector; the
   shared rule reads the classes off the masked element, so there is one
   node holding the state and it is the one the state is about. */

/* =====================================================================
   v29h · BEAT 4 · THE SHARE SCREEN

   Three cards in a carousel, one toggle, two buttons, and nothing is
   ever laid over the card — if the player screenshots the picker instead
   of sharing, no control lands in the shot.

   C IS THE DEFAULT and it is re-asserted on every arrival, for the same
   reason the old beat re-asserted its own: most players never swipe, so
   the card that opens is the card that ships, and a module variable would
   quietly make the last pick the default for the rest of the session.

   THE CARD IS DRAWN ONCE, AT 1080px, AND SCALED. The preview in the
   track is the same DOM the export serialises — a 1080×1920 card under a
   transform — so what the player sees and what goes out cannot drift.
   The card's stylesheet lives in proto.css between the @ec-start /
   @ec-end markers and is read from there at export time, so it is
   written once and the export cannot fall behind the screen.

   THE EXPORT ROUTE is SVG <foreignObject> → <img> → canvas → PNG. No
   library. Four things were measured on real hardware on 09 Sep and are
   not negotiable — each is marked NON-NEGOTIABLE where it is honoured:
     1 · the SVG is a data: URL. A blob: URL taints the canvas.
     2 · fonts and images are base64-inlined into the SVG.
     3 · the inlining is warmed when the end-game mounts (shWarm(), called
         from endGame() and nowhere else).
     4 · the SVG image is drawn twice, 50ms apart, before toBlob.
