   COIN TABLES — and the disagreement between them.

   'sheet'  §0.3 as audited, plus §1.4d. The claim pays only if correct;
            beat 2 pays NOTHING, because §1.4d is categorical: "beat 2 is
            never scored, never rewarded, never compared to a correct
            answer." Topic completion pays 100 — which the shipped code
            does not do at all.
   'brief'  the table confirmed in the brief: 25 for answering the claim,
            25 for taking a position, 25 per correct cascade guess. This
            is what app.js actually does today.

   CONSEQUENCE OF 'sheet', and it is a real one: a correct-only claim
   award cannot fire at beat 1, because paying out would resolve the
   claim four beats early. Under 'sheet' it is deferred to beat 5.
   --------------------------------------------------------------------- */
/* ===== §0 · THE AWARD TABLE ==========================================
   WHY IT CHANGED. The old table paid nothing for finishing and nothing
   for taking a position, so a round's whole value was its cascade: r1
   (9 MK cards) paid 250 and the five rounds with no MK data at all paid
   25. A 10:1 spread between rounds that look identical from the player's
   side — and the short ones are short because of a DATA GAP, not because
   they are worth less. The table was teaching that long rounds matter
   more, which is false.

   THE TACHLES AWARD IS FLAT AND UNCONDITIONAL. Identical for בעד, נגד
   and נמנע, paid the moment a position is taken, never scored and never
   compared against anything. It is what makes the 121st-MK conceit true
   mechanically — the player's position counts — and the instant it is
   conditional on being "right" it becomes an opinion poll with a grade
   on it. Nothing near it may carry a correctness colour, a tick, or
   verdict language. See pinVote() and the note at the beat-2 award.

   NOTHING IS ADVERTISED BEFORE A CHOICE. There is no "+25" beside the
   vote chips or on the claim card anywhere in this file. A price tag
   before a decision moves attention from the content to the points, and
   on the tachles beat it would turn taking a position into a
   transaction. Feedback lands AFTER: the coin flies, the counter ticks.

   `brief` IS THE RECORD OF WHAT THE BRIEF SAID, not a live mode. It is
   kept so the disagreement stays visible; only `sheet` is reachable
   without a query string. */

   WEBKIT SCROLLS THE LAYOUT VIEWPORT ANYWAY when a focused field would

/* ===================== §B · THE PLAYER'S PROFILE ====================
   §4.1: no creation step. A default avatar is assigned instantly and the
   HUD sticker is the door to changing it. PROFILE is the whole of what
   the player has said about themselves, and it is ADDITIVE to the save —
   a save written before it simply has none and restores to these
   defaults, the same reasoning `cf` used. No SAVE_VER bump.
     avatarId · a preset's id. Defaults to the first preset at boot.
     name     · optional, cleaned by cleanName(), at most NAME_MAX. The
                field is in 2b; the keyboard it summons is handled by
                kbSync() (§N) and is the one thing here that can only be
                verified on a phone.
     gender   · null | 'm' | 'f'. null is the PLURAL copy, which is what
                the game speaks today. NEVER forced: the board draws
                לשון זכר selected and app.js writes 'm' on save, and both
                are the old build.
     invited  · Part C's once-only flag — the identity-moment invitation
                has been shown (or forfeited) and never comes back.
     cfg      · the built character (§D): {skin, hair, hairColor, eyes,
                clothes, bg}, option ids from BLD. null = the preset wins;
                set, it outranks the preset — see avatarSvg(). */

/* ===================== §D · THE BUILT CHARACTER ====================
   The eight presets are hand-drawn single SVGs; nothing can edit them.
   So the builder is not "adjust this one" — it is "build your own from
   nothing", and what it builds is drawn by THIS generator, ported from
   app.js:4-94 (the source of truth the Builder boards cite for "every
   category and label"). Two representations coexist in PROFILE — a
   chosen preset (avatarId) or a built character (cfg) — exactly one is
   active, and neither destroys the other; see avatarSvg() for which.

   THE SIX AXES: the CHAR board's five in its order, ids/colours/labels
   as shipped, then the BACKGROUND, which is ours. app.js painted the
   square behind the figure as the outfit at 15%, the presets paint it as
   the skin, and the disc shell reads that square's fill as the disc —
   so under the shell a build's face and ground were one colour and the
   head had no edge; at s4/s5 the figure vanished into itself. The ground
   is CHOSEN now: six flat neutrals and tints that sit apart from every
   skin tone (all five skins are hue 25–27; the nearest ground is kraft
   at hue 43 with a third of the saturation, and the four tints are 100+
   hues away), none of them lime or magenta, the default being the tone
   AV3's own disc wears. The grey is the one DARK ground, pushed cool
   (hue 213) and well below kraft in value: a pale grey sat at the same
   value as kraft and was a wasted option. Labels are ours, a TAMAR item.
   One set of shipped labels is not words: the skin tones are labelled
   with the emoji skin-tone modifiers 🏻…🏿, which are swatches, not
   names — Part B shows the colour and leaves the naming to Tamar. */

       null draws the tie — and flagged in the Part A report.
     · axis values are ids resolved through BLD (hex accepted).
     · a missing skin falls back to BLD_SKIN_DEFAULT, not s1.
     · the background rect is the chosen bg axis, opaque, not the outfit
       at 15%: roundShell() reads that rect's fill as the disc. (The
       outfit tint would have become a solid outfit-coloured disc; the
       skin tone, tried first, left the head with no edge.)
     · no xmlns on the root — inline SVG, same as the presets.
   NOT here, tried and removed: a paper keyline inside every hair shape,
   for black hair on the darkest skin. It read as a headband on short
   hair and as beads on curly — a different hairstyle, not a rim. With
   the ground no longer the skin, s5 × שחור reads as hair on its own. */

   ONE ISSUE, AND a2 IS NOT AN ARBITRARY PICK. Only 6 of the 11 active
   issues carry MK vote data at all, and accountability is the ONLY topic
   holding two of them (a1 and a2). So a2 is the single place in the game
   where the player is guaranteed to have just played a normal cascade in
   the SAME TOPIC, arriving here by לסוגיה הבאה — pattern first, break
   second. Converting any other issue would delete its topic's only
   cascade and the break would have nothing to break from.

   steps, 1.4s apart, settled at 5.6s.
   IT NEVER REACHES ZERO while the question is open. 1px is a softened
   photograph of a real politician, which is fine; the sequence has no
   step that deforms a face, because every step is a Gaussian blur and a
   Gaussian blur cannot deform — it only removes. That is the whole
   reason the mechanic is blur and not pixelation, mosaic or warp. */

   all the information arrived between 13 and 7 and the last step was

   1.4s cost 5 coins for a face the player already had. This spaces the

/* THE DEALING RULE, and it had to be written rather than assumed. It is
   TWO constraints, and the second one only became visible once the first
   was built and the deal was read back off the running page.

   1 · THE STATED VOTE MUST NOT IDENTIFY THE ANSWER.
   a2 is 3 for / 3 against, so an unconstrained trio hands the player
   one, two or three names all holding the stated vote at random. The
   question is "who is this" and its answer is the FACE — there is never
   more than one correct name — but how far the stated vote narrows the
   field is a design decision, not an accident:
     one of three holds it  -> the clue is SUFFICIENT. a2's split IS the
       coalition/opposition line, so anyone who can read that answers
       without ever looking at the face and the blur is decoration again
       — which is the flaw that got the earlier options rejected.
     two of three hold it   -> the clue narrows three to two and the FACE
       decides. Knowledge helps; recognition finishes.
   Shipping two.

   2 · THE FREE PARTY HINT MUST NOT IDENTIFY THE ANSWER EITHER, and this
   is the one that nearly shipped broken. In a2 all three `for` MKs are
   הליכוד and each of the three `against` MKs is a party of one. So if
   the pictured MK is drawn from the opposition side, "the party is יש
   עתיד" IS the answer, spelled out, for free, in one tap. A hint that
   resolves the question is a solve button, and a free solve button is
   the round not existing.
   So the pictured MK is drawn only from those who have same-party
   company in the pool, and EXACTLY ONE distractor shares their party.
   The hint then always narrows three to two and never to one.

   WHAT FALLS OUT OF THIS IN a2, and it is a fact about the data rather
   than about the rule: party and vote are perfectly correlated on the
   coalition side, so the pair the vote clue leaves and the pair the
   party hint leaves are THE SAME PAIR. The hint is redundant with the
   stated vote for a player who reasons from the vote, and still useful
   to one who does not. It is never misleading and never sufficient,
   which is the bar. On an issue whose parties cross the vote line the
   two clues would narrow to different pairs and intersect on the
   answer — the rule is written for that case too. */

   the PREVIOUS round. a2 could not be opened at all and the inverted
   round was unreachable in the build.

   IT HAS TO BE SEEDED, not Math.random(): the note above says so, ?invseed
   exists to vary it deliberately, and the contrast with the normal deal
   is the point — newRound() shuffles the cascade with Math.random() and
   this one is repeatable so a screenshot and a playtest are.

   climbs the gutter clear of the artwork, and cuts in to the chip across
   the empty strip ABOVE the card. It touches the card only in its blank
   outer margin, never the portrait, the name plate or the stamp it just

   name (איתמר בן-גביר rendering as יתמר בן-גביר). The chyron is in FLOW
   between the HUD and the round, so it cannot overlap the card at any
   viewport: the card's top edge starts below it, by construction.

   The element itself lives in index.html and is never created or removed,
   only filled and emptied — see .chyron.is-empty for why it keeps its box

   the overlay shows. Showing an instruction to somebody who has already
   seen it is a small cost; swallowing it for somebody who has not is the
   whole feature. So every read and write is wrapped and every failure
   resolves toward showing it.

   ?intro=on / ?intro=off OVERRIDES THE FLAG without touching it, which is
   how this gets demoed and tested at all — a feature that by definition
   happens once cannot otherwise be looked at twice.

   element — without this, a returning player opens their second issue and
   the claim card carries no instruction at all.

   IT COSTS THE CARD NOTHING. The sticker is parented to .cardwrap, not to
   the card: .mf-b carries overflow:hidden and would clip it, and anything
   inside the card face would push the name/party block toward the stamp's
   430px band. It overhangs the card's top-right corner, which is the
   corner diagonally opposite the stamp (top:430 left:-22) — the two can
   never meet on any card.

   IT IS CHROME-SCALE, NOT CARD-SCALE. .stack is scaled by sizeStage() so
   a 620px card fits a short phone; left alone the sticker would shrink
   with it and the instruction would be smallest exactly where the screen
   is smallest. .ask-st counter-scales by 1/--card-scale so the settled

   LION'S DECISION, 09 SEP, TAKEN OVER A STOP I RAISED — recorded that way
   on purpose. The locked list named the MK disc as the ONLY surface
   allowed "טעית", so this was flagged rather than applied; Lion widened
   the exception to TWO SURFACES. It is his call, not a reading of the
   old rule, and not something a later editor may extend a third time.

   WAS: 'צדקתם!' / 'הופתעתם!' — plural, and "surprised" where the disc
   said "wrong". Two voices four seconds apart in one round.

   THE PLURAL WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT, WHICH IS WHY THIS NEEDS SAYING OUT
   LOUD: t() treats the PLURAL as the gender-neutral voice, not as a
   fallback — PROFILE.gender === null resolves to the `p` slot, and that
   is the state of every player who skips or un-picks the voice step.

   >>> AND NOT A PRECEDENT. If you are reading this while making some
   >>> other string singular: don't. Nothing here licenses that.

   WHAT THE SINGULAR COSTS TAMAR: nothing. צדקת and טעית are spelled
   identically in the masculine and feminine second-person past —
   צָדַקְתָּ/צָדַקְתְּ and טָעִיתָ/טָעִית differ only in pointing, which
   this build does not set — so neither adds a slot to the gendered set.
   It also RETIRES a debt: 'צדקתם'/'הופתעתם' are masculine plural, the

       · IT THEREFORE HAS TO LEAVE WITH THE CARD. Under the chyron it was
         removed on הלאה; on .cardwrap it would be left hanging in mid-air
         while the card and the stamp fly out. See the exit below.
     THE CHYRON SLOT IS UNAFFECTED. The reserved 44px box is .chyron-slot,
     a separate element that stays in .sc-round's FLOW on every beat;
     .chyron is the absolutely-positioned banner that was placed over it.

     macOS and iOS both draw an overlay scrollbar, which is invisible at
     rest and takes no width, so what the player sees is a paragraph
     sliced horizontally through the middle of a line of Hebrew. That is
     indistinguishable from a rendering fault, and the reflex it produces
     is to tap הלאה rather than to drag.
     .has-more masks the scroller's bottom edge, and .is-atend takes the
     mask off again once there is nothing left below — a fade that stays
     up at the end of the text says there is more when there is not.

     geometry is final on this line — synchronously, before the rAF that

/* ===== B3-3 · THE DIE-CUT STICKER MODAL ==============================
   ONE COMPONENT, TWO CONTENTS, and that is the whole point of building it
   this way. B3-3 was picked for the law modal and §3.1 moves the glossary
   term onto the same treatment; a second modal would be a second set of
   paddings, a second dismiss and a second way for the two to drift apart.
   Everything that differs between the two is an ARGUMENT — title, meta,
   body, optional graphic — and everything that is shared is the sticker.

   IT IS CENTRED, WHICH COSTS SOMETHING AND IS STILL RIGHT. The v17 board
   recorded the objection: centring covers the tachles question while the
   law is open, so the player loses the thing they were about to answer.
   That is true of the glossary term too. The trade is deliberate — the
   modal is a detour the player asked for, it dismisses three ways, and
   the question is intact underneath it the instant it closes.

   THREE WAYS OUT, none of them hidden: the ✕, the ground, and Escape.

   SPOILER RISK carries over unchanged: on s1 and m2 the bill text names
   an MK who is in that round's own cascade. Tamar's copy is not edited
   and no MK is dropped; both issues carry `spoiler_risk:true` in data.js
   and stay on her list. The treatment cannot fix that; only her copy can.  */

/* T5b · THE OUTCOME SENTENCE COMES OFF THE BILL SUMMARY BEFORE IT IS SHOWN.
   bill_summary is a CONTEXT field with an OUTCOME sentence welded onto the
   end of it on some issues — s1 finishes "עבר 61 מול 55." and its own
   _tally is {for:61, against:55}, the exact pair the finale board counts up
   to. The modal opens at beat 2. Left whole, the field hands the player the
   answer two beats before the cascade asks for it, which is the locked
   "crowd data never appears between the player's own vote and the reveal".
   The split is here rather than in data.js because the field is Tamar's to
   write and Roman's to serve; this is the one place it is read.

   THE BOUNDARY IS A SENTENCE, NOT A SUBSTRING. Cutting at the first digit
   would have taken e1's "המע\"מ ל-18%", a1's "90 ח\"כים" and v1's climate
   targets — all context, all load-bearing. The unit removed is the final
   SENTENCE, and only when that sentence carries a vote count.

   WHAT COUNTS AS A VOTE COUNT. The data writes "מול", not "בעד/נגד" —
   "עבר 61 מול 55", "עברה בקריאה טרומית 55 מול 10". Both forms are matched
   anyway, because vote_result (beat 5's own field) writes the other one,
   "27 חברי כנסת בעד, 42 נגד", and the CMS has no rule keeping the two
   fields in separate dialects. Verified over every issue in data.js: the
   pattern fires on 14 of the 16 vote_result strings — the two it skips
   have no numbers in them at all — and on exactly 2 of the 16
   bill_summary fields, s1 and s2, in both cases on the last sentence.

   WHEN IT CANNOT CUT CLEANLY IT DOES NOT CUT. If the count sits anywhere
   but the final sentence, the summary is returned whole rather than
   guessed at, and the issue is a content report. No issue is in that state
   today; the branch exists so that a future one is visible instead of
   silently mangled. */

/* ===== §D · 2c THE BUILDER ============================================
   The CHAR board (v16 canvas, V15CHAR): the preview on its card up top,
   then a kraft sheet with a progress line, ONE axis at a time as a grid
   of white tiles — a mini figure and a name on each — and chevrons at
   the foot. Inside the same sticker 2a and 2b use, content swapped in
   place, so there is one sticker on screen throughout.

   TWO REPRESENTATIONS, ONE ACTIVE. PROFILE.avatarId is the chosen
   preset; PROFILE.cfg is the built character; avatarSvg() ranks cfg
   first. Opening the builder changes NOTHING: `work` is a private copy
   (the saved cfg, or the defaults) and cfg is written only by an axis
   tap or a shuffle — the first such write is the moment the HUD and the
   six consumers switch from preset to build. Open-and-✕ leaves the
   preset active and cfg null. Picking a preset on 2a clears cfg (see
   renderSheet), so both-set never persists.

   THE VOICE STEP. The generator has two bodies and no neutral one, and
   the game never chooses a voice for the player (§B). So when the
   builder opens with no voice set, its FIRST step is the voice question
   — 2b's two chips as tiles showing each body, plus לא משנה, which picks
   one of the two at random and moves on. It writes PROFILE.gender, the
   same field 2b's chips write, and NOT cfg: answering it and closing
   activates no build. If a voice is set the step is not there.

   THE COUNT NEVER LIES because it is never stored: the step list is
   recomputed from the state on every paint — voice (if the builder was
   opened without one), then the six axes less hairColor when the hair is
   קרח. So it reads N מתוך 6, 5 on the bald path, 7 with the voice step,
   and the moment קרח is tapped on the hair axis the line re-reads 5.
   The voice step stays in the list for the whole visit once shown, so
   the count does not jump from 7 to 6 under the player's thumb after
   they answer; prev from the first axis returns to it.

   HAIR COLOUR ON THE HIJAB PATH is the same axis with a different
   heading (BLD_TITLE.hairColorHijab): it colours the scarf, on purpose.

   SHUFFLE is one button, one tap, one result: every axis re-rolled from
   its own list, voice untouched, committed like a tap. No animation
   that rewards a second tap, no sound.

   NO DONE GATE. Every tap already saved. Prev on the first step and the
   ✕ both return to 2b; so does next on the last step (סיימתי), which
   is the same one-way door 2b's שמור is — it closes, it has nothing to
   save — because a chevron that dies on the last step is a dead end. */

   what would make this read as six animations instead of one move.

/* ===== v26 · THE תכלס TAB AND THE PROMPT'S TAIL =====================
   Both decided on explorations/v26/tachles-tab.html in ~/dev/hachach-121;
   the numbers below are that board's, measured, not estimated.

   THE SPLIT MATCHES THE SUFFIX STRING, NOT THE DASH. Every one of the
   sixteen tachles_prompt values ends with the exact run
   "מה ההצבעה שלך?" and every one is preceded by the identical separator
   "- " (U+002D U+0020) — verified across the whole set. The dash is NOT
   matched on, because dashes occur inside the claims themselves (v2's
   חד-פעמיים, a1's ה 7/10, r1's nothing at all): matching the tail's own
   words is the only rule that cannot cut a claim in half.

   THE DASH STAYS. Everything before the suffix is the claim, dash
   included, so the claim reads "…עבור החרדים-" and the CMS text is
   reproduced character for character. Only trailing WHITESPACE is
   trimmed, and only because a space before a display:block sibling is a
   space at the end of a rendered line. Nothing in data.js changes.

   NO SUFFIX, NO SPLIT. A prompt without the run renders exactly as it
   does today, one line, no tail element — which is the branch the
   fallback string takes, since "מה אתה היית מצביע?" is not the same
   words. That branch is live, not theoretical.

   THE TAIL IS ALWAYS ITS OWN LINE, never inline at any width, which is
   what display:block on .b2q__tail buys. Board measurement: pulling the
   tail out drops the claim a whole 33px line on every prompt long enough
   to have been wrapping, so the block gets SHORTER on three of the four
   cases measured (s1 at both widths, g1 at 360) and taller only where
   the claim was already down to two lines. */
const Q_TAIL = 'מה ההצבעה שלך?';                                       /* TAMAR */

/* v26g · THE TAB IS CENTRED ON THE FIRST WORD OF LINE 1.
   v26f anchored to a fraction of line 1 — 20% along from the start end.
   That guaranteed contact on all sixteen and was still wrong: 20% of a
   340px line is 68px in, past the end of any first word, so fifteen of
   the sixteen landed MID-WORD. g1 covered the middle three letters of
   לאפשר with a letter showing either side, which reads as crossing the
   word out rather than tagging it. Only r1, whose line is the shortest,
   happened to cover a whole word.
   The first word's own box is the only anchor that says "this word".

   WIDER THAN THE WORD IS FINE; HALF OF TWO WORDS IS NOT. When the word
   measures less than the tab the tab overhangs it symmetrically rather
   than shrinking or falling back — a tag wider than the thing it tags
   still reads as a tag. The one clamp is the line's own start end: the
   tab never pushes past it, because a tag hanging off the end of the
   line reads as belonging to nothing.

   ONE EXTRA RANGE, NOT A SECOND LAYOUT PASS. The line-1 rects are still
   read exactly as v26f read them — they are what the clamp needs — and
   the word's box comes from one more Range over the same text node,
   measured in the same batch. Still no ResizeObserver: this hangs off
   the resize stack sizeStage/placeChyron/redrawPath already share, and
   is a no-op on every screen with no .b2q__tab, exactly as redrawPath
   is a no-op with no #mapline. */

/* ===== v27 · BEAT 2 FITS, AND THE CHAIR IS WHAT YIELDS ==============
   THE BUG THIS CLOSES. Beat 2 overflowed 360x640 on fourteen of the
   sixteen issues — g2 by 128px, and on s1 the three vote buttons were
   ENTIRELY off the stage, so the player could not vote. .ov--stage is
   place-items:center inside a stage with overflow:hidden, so the excess
   split top and bottom and was clipped in silence: nothing looked
   broken, the buttons were simply not there.

   A BUDGET, NOT A SCALE. The bottom stack is the interaction and never
   moves: the vote row keeps its 60px and its gap, the question keeps
   whatever height its own text needs, and the padding — safe-area
   included — is identical at every viewport. What is left over is the
   chair, which is decoration. It is measured as a remainder rather than
   re-derived term by term, because the terms are spread across four
   rules and a flex gap and a re-derivation would drift the first time
   one of them moved; the remainder is the same number and cannot.

   ONE PASS IS ENOUGH. The chair's height does not change the column
   width, so the question's line breaks — and therefore the non-chair
   remainder — are identical before and after the resize. There is no
   second reflow to chase.

   THE FLOOR IS 150px. Below that the chair stops being the thing the
   question is about and becomes an icon beside it — which is the exact
   failure ITEM 36's predecessor is on record for at clamp(96px,...).
   At 150 the chair is 129px wide and still reads as a chair: arms,
   cushion and pedestal all survive. If the floor is hit and the screen
   still overflows the chair does NOT squash further — that is a
   content-length problem and it is reported as one. */

/* D2 · the verdict stamp. Correctness only — neither ink appears

   THE CENTRE WORD IS HTML, NOT SVG <text>. WebKit lays Hebrew out
   left-to-right inside SVG text — confirmed on device and reproduced in a
   WebKit build here — and no bidi property changes it, so the one route
   that cannot fail is to stop asking SVG to shape Hebrew at all. The disc,
   the two circles and the ink stay SVG; the word is a <span dir="rtl">,
   where bidi is correct in every engine.
   IT IS STILL PRINTED BY THE SAME STAMP. It sits inside .d2, so it lands,
   scales and rotates with the disc as one object; it takes the disc's
   currentColor and the display face at 900; and it carries #ink-h, which
   is #ink rescaled to CSS px, driven off the same clock by inkBleed(). It
   is not type layered on a graphic — it is the same ink.

   THE RING TEXT IS GONE, keeping the ring as a graphic band. Curved text
   has no HTML equivalent that does not hand-place glyphs in visual order,
   which is the source-string reversal we are refusing; leaving it as SVG
   would leave it reversed on iOS. An illegible ring is worse than none.

   PLACEHOLDER COPY, AWAITING THE CLIENT'S SIGN-OFF. These strings and no
   others; do not author alternatives.

   THE RULE, AND THE ONE HOLE PUNCHED IN IT. The locked guardrail is that
   THE PLAYER NEVER FAILS: no "לא נכון", no string that puts the player in
   the subject position of an error, because being wrong here is the
   Knesset surprising you. "הופתעת" said exactly that — it is something
   that happened TO the player.
   T6 · TAMAR OVERRODE IT ON 08 SEP, FOR THIS DISC AND NOTHING ELSE. The
   surprise stamp now reads "טעית!". The exception is deliberately narrow
   and the narrowness is load-bearing, so here is the exact blast radius,
   because the next person to edit this constant will need it:
     · stamp(ok) with no override is called from TWO places, and both are
       the SAME OBJECT — the disc on an MK card. cascade verdict() and the
       inverted round's invResolve(). That is the sanctioned surface.
     · the claim reveal calls stamp(ok, truth) and passes אמת / שקר /
       חלקית, so this constant never reaches the claim card.
     · the verdict PILL is CLAIM_MARK, a different constant on a different
       object. T6c · IT NOW CARRIES THE IDENTICAL PAIR — Lion's decision
       of 09 Sep, which widened the exception from one surface to two.
       The two constants are still SEPARATE, and deliberately: they are
       different objects on different planes, and one of them can be
       retuned without the other. If the pair is ever changed, change it
       in BOTH or the round speaks in two voices again — which is the
       thing T6c existed to fix.
     · the finale, the record and the share card are NOT included. The
       surprise framing is intact on all three and they were never fed by
       either constant.
   DO NOT GENERALISE THIS. Two surfaces is where Lion stopped it. A third
   is a new decision by him, not an extension of this one.
   THE PAIR MATCHES. The first pass of T6 left "צדקת" bare against a
   "טעית!" that had just gained a mark, which read as one of the two
   having been edited and the other forgotten — an exclamation is a
   loudness, and only one side was loud. Tamar closed it on 09 Sep.
   BOTH SIDES OR NEITHER, if this is ever retuned: these two strings are
   the same object in two states and the mark is part of the register,
   not part of the verdict. T6c · AND THE PILL IS NOW A THIRD AND FOURTH
   COPY OF THE SAME TWO WORDS, so "both sides" means all four — see
   CLAIM_MARK, which carries the identical pair and says why.

/* ===== THE SEAT GRID · v20 option 4 ==================================
   THE TITLE, AS A PICTURE. 120 blocks and one more that is the player.
   The civic point of the whole product — you are one seat among 120 —
   delivered as an image instead of a sentence, which is why nothing else
   on this screen may out-weigh it.

   NOT A SEATING CHART, and that is a factual constraint rather than a
   stylistic one. The real chamber is seated by faction, we cannot source
   a true layout, and anything that implied one would be a claim we cannot
   stand behind. So: abstract blocks, an arbitrary 15x8 rectangle, no
   grouping by party, no hemicycle. The order carries no meaning beyond
   "how many".

   THE PLAYER'S SEAT IS THE 121st AND SITS APART, on its own row under the
   120. That is the literal reading of the title and it is also what keeps
   it visible in the empty state, where every other block is dark.

   WHY IT IS CODED BY SHAPE AND NOT BY HUE. It must never be coloured as
   either side. Both side hues are taken, the two correctness hues are
   forbidden, the chyron's cyan is on screen at this beat, and the only
   remaining candidate — --primary yellow — sits dE 21.6 from the נגד
   ecru, which is too close for two squares in one grid. So it is the only
   ROUND block, the only one with a keyline, and the only one set apart.
   Form does the work that hue cannot, and the yellow is then free to say
   "you" the way it does everywhere else in the system.

   THE REMAINDER IS HONEST. for + against does not reach 120 on three of
   the four issues that have a tally — a1 is 53+48 = 101 — and the other
   19 are simply not in the record. They stay dark. Nothing here invents an
   abstention or an absence it was not given. */
/* ===================== §S-1 · THE FINALE ============================
   THE 11x11 SEAT GRID IS REJECTED AND GONE — seatPlan(), seatBoard() and
   runTally() with it. On the record: the interleaved fill was a
   constraint set to avoid implying factional seating, and it worked, but
   it produced a checkerboard nobody can read a majority off. Honest and
   illegible. What replaces it is V20-2's family — two numbers, left and
   right, a bar between, counting up — plus the move the grid could never
   make: the player's own token flying to the side they voted for. The
   121st-MK conceit is delivered by an ACTION rather than by a dot in a
   grid.

   THE BEAT IS A SEQUENCE, NOT A SCREEN, and that is the whole design.
   It had been drawn three times as a static layout and each read as
   chaotic, because everything arrived at once with no order of
   importance. Four rules govern the order:
     - the TALLY is the peak, and NOTHING else may land while it counts
     - the FLIGHT is a second beat, watchable, never simultaneous
     - the COINS get a moment of their own

   leaving.

   screen, it is an empty one with a button. .pr-ph therefore carries the
   same hazard treatment ph() draws but is not subject to that switch —
   it is meant to be impossible to miss and impossible to ship.

/* ---- ITEM 11 · THE 121ST VOTE IS COUNTED ---------------------------
   The board has said what the Knesset did. This is the only moment in the
   game where the player's own vote is added to it, and all three things
   that say so move together on one 220ms curve: the numeral ticks, the
   numeral goes gold, and the bar segment grows by one unit of its own
   scale.

   IT DERIVES FROM THE SAME PLACE THE COUNT DOES. `tally` is the object
   beat5() reads out of issue._tally and hands to runCount() — one source,
   passed in, never re-read from the DOM and never a second field name. If
   the CMS reconciliation moves the board onto tally_for/tally_against,
   beat5()'s single read moves with it and this follows for free. Reading
   the numeral's own text back off the screen would have been the other
   option and it is worse: it makes the animation depend on a rendering
   rather than on the record.

   THE 61 MARKER DOES NOT MOVE, and there is no branch here that could
   move it. A +1 that crosses 61 gets exactly what a +1 that does not
   gets. No issue in the data reaches it — the closest is s1, which is
   already ON 61 — but the rule is structural, not a fact about the data.

   THE PROGRESS MODEL · §3.2, and the one place the data did not answer.

   WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN data.js: 16 issues, exactly 2 per topic, and ONE
   boolean — `core`. It is true on the first issue of every topic and false
   on the second. There is no third issue anywhere and no field that says
   "bonus". So the fields available to distinguish a bonus issue from a
   non-bonus one are: `core`, and nothing else.

   THE TWO READINGS OF `core:false`, and they are incompatible:
     app.js  treats it as THE BONUS. x/8 counts core issues only
             (app.js:248-251, doneCore/totalCore), and the topic-complete
             screen offers the other issue as "סוגיית בונוס" (app.js:546).
             Under that reading, finishing s1 alone would read 1/8.
     the sheet  §0.2 says "8 topics x 2 סוגיות = 16 rounds, PLUS bonus
             סוגיות per topic", and §3.2 puts one ring segment per סוגיה
             with bonus explicitly outside the ring. Under that reading
             BOTH issues are ring segments and the bonus is a third thing
             that has not been written yet.

   THE SHEET WINS — the brief says so where the sources disagree, and the
   state the brief asks to see confirms it: complete s1, and the node shows
   1 of 2 segments while the headline still reads 0/8. That is only true if
   s2 is a segment rather than the bonus.

   RESOLVED BY THE SHEET. Tamar's set has eleven issues over six topics and
   no bonus among them, so the concept is gone rather than stubbed: no
   marker, no seam, no demo flag. `core` no longer decides anything here —
   it has been reassigned to "first ACTIVE issue in the topic" purely so
   app.js's derived progress maths keeps working, and this file orders by
   array position instead.
   ===================================================================== */

/* issueId -> true. THIS NOW SURVIVES A RELOAD — see THE SAVE below.

   live here has not been dropped; it has moved to ?reset, because it can
   no longer be a consequence of writing nothing down. */

   THE SAVE · ONE KEY, ONE VERSION, AND ONLY WHAT THE END-GAME READS.

   WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. PROGRESS and the wallet were session-only by
   choice, and the choice was right while the game ended by looping back
   to the map. It stops being right the moment there is an end-game: a
   player who reloads on issue 9 of 11 loses the run, and the end-game is
   the one screen whose whole content is the run.

   WHAT IS STORED, AND WHY EACH FIELD EARNS ITS PLACE. Nothing here is
   speculative — every field is read by a beat that is specified:
     wallet          the coins to allocate                    (beat 3)
     progress        which issues are done; the map, and the
                     completion test topicsDone() === TOPICS().length
     record[id].claim   did the claim surprise them           (beats 2, 4)
     record[id].pos     their own vote, for the alignment line (beat 2)
     record[id].hits    correct MK predictions this round     (beats 2, 4)
     record[id].cards   how many were asked, so `hits` has a
                        denominator that is not re-derived later
     cf              whether the one celebration has been spent
   The surprise count is (claim ? 0 : 1) + (cards - hits), summed. The
   alignment record compares `pos` to _tally, which lives in data.js and
   is therefore never stored.

   WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT STORED. No timings. No per-MK answer history:
   WHICH member was missed is answer history, the counts are the beat's
   content, and only the counts are kept. No analytics of any kind. No
   avatar, no settings — the DEV switches are URL state and stay that way.

   FAILING OPEN, THREE WAYS. A save is discarded whole rather than
   repaired, because a half-trusted save is how a broken map gets
   rendered:
     1 · version mismatch — the shape changed under it
     2 · an issue id that is not in DATA — the content set moved and the
         progress no longer describes anything real
     3 · anything malformed — not an object, wallet not a finite number
   In all three the store is cleared and the session starts clean, which
   is exactly the behaviour of a first-ever visit.

   B5-1, BUILT, AND CENTRED IN BOTH AXES. The board drew it as a sheet at
   the foot; §3.3 centres it horizontally AND vertically instead, which is
   what a destructive confirm should do — a bottom sheet is the shape of
   an options menu, and this is not one. It is the same die-cut sticker
   the law modal is, on the same dimmed ground, so the round has exactly
   one modal shape rather than one for content and another for confirms.

   THE QUESTION AND THE CONSEQUENCE ARE TWO LINES NOW. They used to be one
   string doing both jobs — "לצאת מהסוגיה? ההתקדמות בה לא תישמר" — which
   made the consequence read as part of the question rather than as the
   thing the player is agreeing to. §3.3 splits them: the question in
   black at body size, the consequence under it, quieter.

   THREE WAYS TO STAY and one to leave. The ✕, the ground and להישאר all

   rainbow across the title, which is the thing that was rejected on the

   symbol, one of the six topics is מגדר ושוויון, and the app's own
   wordmark is the last place to put an unintended political statement.

   being one object. `?title=multi` no longer exists; it falls back to
   solid like any unknown value.
   WHAT REPLACES IT IS A SECOND STROKE, OUTSIDE THE WHITE. Two <text>
   elements per glyph: the first paints a wider coloured stroke and
   nothing else, the second is the existing white-cut-over-black exactly
   as it ships. Painted in that order the colour survives only as the few

/* ===================== §1 · THE LOADING BEAT ========================
   The intro empties, the chair grows into the middle, a bar fills under
   it, and then the destination.

   THE DESTINATION IS AN ARGUMENT. Today the only caller passes goMap;
   when character creation lands between them it passes that instead, and
   nothing in here changes. The beat deliberately knows nothing about
   where it is going — it is a transition, not a router.

   THE BAR IS FAKE AND THE CODE SHOULD NOT PRETEND OTHERWISE. Nothing is
   being fetched, decoded or waited on: the fill runs on --t-load-fill and
   that is the entire mechanism. When there IS something to load, that
   clock is what gets replaced with the real signal; the shape of the
   beat, the copy and the geometry all survive it.

   NO LABEL UNDER THE BAR, and it was a real choice between 'טוען את
   הכנסת…' and nothing:
     - the bar is fake, and a label naming the work asserts something that
       is not happening. When it becomes true it will be true for a
       different reason, which is a bad thing for shipped copy to be
       waiting on.
     - the beat exists to go from four objects on screen to ONE. Adding a
       third element back — chair, bar, line — undoes the reduction that
       is the entire point of it.
     - it is on screen for 2.2 seconds. Nobody reads it, and a Hebrew line
       nobody reads is still a Hebrew line somebody has to write, review
       and translate.
   The chair and a cyan bar already say wait. What a label WOULD have
   carried is the accessible name, so that goes on the element itself as
   role=progressbar + aria-label: announced, never drawn.

   prefers-reduced-motion SKIPS THE WHOLE BEAT rather than shortening it.
   A 2.2s wait with no motion is just a delay, and a delay is the one
   thing this is not allowed to be. */

/* §1.1 WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A MASK, and why that is the structural fix
   rather than the cosmetic one.

   The mask punched a hole of r = --ring-r at every node centre, so the
   ribbon ended on the ring's CENTRELINE and the ring stroke was supposed
   to cover the cut. Two things made that fail, and neither is tunable:
     · the segments have the board's 27.2-degree gaps in them, and for a
       two-issue topic those gaps land at the TOP and the BOTTOM of the
       ring — exactly where the ribbon arrives. There is no stroke there
       to cover anything, at any weight.
     · inside the ring's inner edge the ground is charcoal, and the mask
       had removed the ribbon from all of it. So even where the stroke did
       cover the cut, the annulus between the disc and the ring showed
       charcoal where the road should have been.
   Thickening the stroke (the third option in the brief) fixes neither: it
   narrows the annulus without closing it and does nothing about the gaps.
   Shrinking the hole to the disc's radius (the first) fixes both, but it
   leaves a mask whose radius has to be kept in step with --node-face and
   --node-depth by hand, and a hole that is a few px too large puts the
   charcoal ring straight back.

   So the mask is gone. The ribbon is one uncut path and the DISC covers
   it — .node is z-index 2 over .path-line's 1, which was already true and
   is now the only thing doing the work. The path cannot read as severed
   because it is not cut, and there is no second radius to drift.

   WHAT IS NOW VISIBLE INSIDE THE RING is the ribbon itself, crossing the
   7px of open ground between the disc and the ring at the top and bottom
   of every node. That is the road passing behind the node, which is what
   it should look like, and it is only legible at all because 1.4 pulled
   the ring back in — at the 18.5px stand-off the old overhang forced, the
   same ribbon read as a bar across the gap. */

/* ===== A4b · THE ROUND IS UNMOUNTED, NOT HIDDEN ======================
   showScreen() toggles `hidden` on the four .screen sections and on the
   chyron, and that is all it knows about. The beat-2/3 surface is not one
   of them: .ov--stage is a child of #stage — it has to be, or the blur
   stops at .round's padding and the dot grid shows through at every
   border — so hiding the round left the chair, the prompt and the three
   vote chips painted over the map at z-index 9, above everything the map
   draws, with their handlers still attached. Its only removal was its own
   beat-3 dismiss tap, which is a tap the player who just left the round
   is by definition not going to make.

   REMOVING THAT ONE NODE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SYMPTOM'S FIX. What was
   actually wrong is that a round had no teardown at all: S kept the
   abandoned round's beat, position and guesses until the next newRound()
   happened to overwrite it, #round kept the whole beat's DOM behind the
   hidden screen, the chyron kept whatever the last beat pinned in it, and
   the inverted round's step timers kept firing against a round that no
   longer exists. This is that teardown, and it is the ONE place that
   knows what a round parents outside itself.

   S IS SET TO NULL, NOT EMPTIED. Every reader of it either runs inside a
   round or already guards (exitRound), and a null is what makes a stale
   timer's `S.phase` test fail outright instead of quietly passing against
   the dead round's state.

   .stmodal[data-profile] IS NOT A ROUND'S. It is the map's character

   §E · THE END-GAME, FIVE BEATS.

   WHAT IT REPLACES. The terminal state used to be a loop: beat 5's exit
   was a per-topic question, so the last issue of the last topic fell
   through to חזרה למפה, the map read 6/6, and tapping any node replayed
   it (openTopic's `|| topicIssues(id)[0]` fallback). Nothing in the game
   could say it was over. gameDone() says it now.

   EVERY NUMBER ON THIS SCREEN IS DERIVED, and derived HERE. There is no
   stored total anywhere: endStats() reads RECORD — written one round at
   a time by beat 5 — and data.js, on every entry. Re-cut the content and
   the end-game re-counts. That is why the brief's own example figures
   (11 surprises, 5 of 8) appear nowhere in this file: they were written
   against the 16-round set and would be a lie on this one.

   THE FIVE BEATS ARE FOUR SCREENS. Beats 4 and 5 share one, because
   "the buttons arrive last and stay" is a statement about the card's
   screen — the exits arrive under the card and do not replace it.
   ===================================================================== */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE DERIVATIONS.

   A SURPRISE IS A PREDICTION REALITY DID NOT MATCH, and both kinds
   count: the claim at beat 1 and every MK at beat 4. That makes the
   arithmetic closed — asked = correct + surprises — so the share card
   and the record screen can never disagree, which is the §0.4 rule
   about the game never lying about its own numbers.

   THE ALIGNMENT DENOMINATOR IS THE ISSUES THAT CARRY A VOTE COUNT, and
   it is small on purpose: only 4 of the 11 active issues have _tally, so
   only 4 have a documented outcome to compare a position against. The
   alternative — inferring a direction from some other field — would
   invent an outcome the data does not state, on a product whose whole
   credibility is documented votes. So the number stays 4 and the COPY
   says what the 4 is.
   AN ABSTENTION IS COUNTED AND NEVER MATCHES. Dropping נמנע from the
   denominator would make it move per player and the sentence stop being
   checkable; keeping it is also just true — an abstention is not a vote
   with the majority.
   HARD GUARDRAIL (§1.4c, sheet p.11): the comparison is to WHAT
   HAPPENED, never to who the player resembles. There is no party, bloc
   or MK anywhere in this section, and there must never be one.

   3/5, and it covered the results table. Both are answered here by the
   same two rules — it fires ONCE, on completing the map, and it lands
   AFTER the screen has settled.

   NEVER OVER CONTENT, STRUCTURALLY. #egFx is a sibling BEFORE .eg-col

   is a stacking fact rather than a timing promise: even if the copy grew

   across the screen, which is the exact thing lsGlyph() rejected on the

   a pride symbol, one of the six live topics is מגדר ושוויון, and a
   celebration is the last place to make an unintended political
   statement. The pieces take the app's own neutrals and the coin's gold.

   BEAT 3 · THE ALLOCATION.

   THE TARGETS ARE THE GAME'S OWN TOPICS, and that is the whole argument
   (§0.3b): a curated list of "legitimate causes" is itself an editorial
   act — who decided ביטחון counts and זכויות עובדים does not — and the
   six topics the player has just spent eleven rounds inside sidestep it
   entirely. TOPICS() is read live, so a re-cut content set re-cuts this
   screen and nothing here has to be told.

   CHIPS AND A SIMPLE SPLIT, NOT A SLIDER. The sheet's minimal v1
   (p.4, option b) verbatim. A tap adds one portion; the portion is a
   tenth of what was earned, rounded to the game's own 25-coin unit, so
   the numbers on screen stay in the vocabulary the round taught.

   EVERY COIN IS ALLOCATABLE. The last portion is whatever is left rather
   than a fixed step — without that, a 1,900 wallet and a 200 step strand
   100 coins nobody can place, which would make "distribute your coins" a
   promise the screen does not keep. That was the original build's whole
   failure and it is not being repeated in a new shape.

   LEAVING COINS UNSPENT IS A VALID END STATE. The continue button is
   never gated on a full allocation: this is a statement of priorities,
   not a puzzle with a solution, and a completion gate would turn it into
   one. NO SCARCITY, NO TIMER, NO PRESSURE COPY.

   THE HUD CHIP DOES NOT MOVE. It keeps showing what was earned, because
   that is a fact about the run; what is left to place is this screen's
   own line. Spending out of the HUD would also mean writing a smaller
   number into the save, and the save records the run, not this screen.

   Feedback only. Nothing here reads or writes ALLOC, egPortion() or the

   THE ROW'S NUMBER WAITS FOR THE COINS. That is the whole point of the
   item and it is the one thing here that touches the render: the tap
   moves the state immediately (so the balance is honest and a second tap
   is charged correctly), but the ROW keeps showing what it was showing
   until the first token lands. Without that the number changes on tap and
   the flight is decoration arriving after the fact.
   The hold is a data attribute on the chip rather than a variable,
   because egPaint() is the one painter and it has to be able to see it.

   THREE FLIGHTS, NEVER A QUEUE. A fourth tap inside the window gets no
   sprites at all — it decrements, it increments, and it is done. Nothing
   is buffered: a backlog would land coins seconds after the tap that
   bought them, which is worse than no coins.

   TAMAR'S DECISION, 09 SEP 2026: THE FREE TEXT GOES ON THE CARD.
   Until this date the walk below covered TOPICS() only — data.js's own
   eight — and the free-text row, whose coins sit under OTHER_KEY and
   whose words sit in ALLOC_OTHER_NAME, could not reach a card by
   construction. Tamar asked for the player's own words on the card, so
   the row is appended to the walk as a ninth entry, marked `free` so the
   card can dress it as authored (kraft, ✎) rather than as a topic. This
   is NOT a bug and NOT drift; the next reader should not "fix" it. It is
   paired with OTHER_MAX dropping to 11 — see the note there — because
   the words now have to fit a pill.
   An unnamed row with coins on it shows as אחר.

/* =====================================================================
   v29h · BEAT 4 · THE SHARE SCREEN

   Three cards in a carousel, one toggle, two buttons, and nothing is
   ever laid over the card — if the player screenshots the picker instead
   of sharing, no control lands in the shot.

   C IS THE DEFAULT and it is re-asserted on every arrival, for the same
   reason the old beat re-asserted its own: most players never swipe, so
   the card that opens is the card that ships, and a module variable would
   quietly make the last pick the default for the rest of the session.

   THE CARD IS DRAWN ONCE, AT 1080px, AND SCALED. The preview in the
   track is the same DOM the export serialises — a 1080×1920 card under a
   transform — so what the player sees and what goes out cannot drift.
   The card's stylesheet lives in proto.css between the @ec-start /
   @ec-end markers and is read from there at export time, so it is
   written once and the export cannot fall behind the screen.

   THE EXPORT ROUTE is SVG <foreignObject> → <img> → canvas → PNG. No
   library. Four things were measured on real hardware on 09 Sep and are
   not negotiable — each is marked NON-NEGOTIABLE where it is honoured:
     1 · the SVG is a data: URL. A blob: URL taints the canvas.
     2 · fonts and images are base64-inlined into the SVG.
     3 · the inlining is warmed when the end-game mounts (shWarm(), called
         from endGame() and nowhere else).
     4 · the SVG image is drawn twice, 50ms apart, before toBlob.
